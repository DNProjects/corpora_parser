L549522 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
L549126 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.

L549006 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I killed her!
L549005 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Ben!  What's wrong?
L548984 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
L548983 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ &quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
L548867 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
L548866 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
L548857 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
L548856 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
L550073 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Good.  That's very good.
L550072 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I'll miss you so much.
L550071 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
L550070 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Yes.
L550069 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
L550068 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Until he's old enough to read.
L550067 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
L550064 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Let me be the judge of that.
L550063 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I'm not.
L550062 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
L550061 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Don't. Take me with you.
L550060 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I don't want to say goodbye.
L549749 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
L549748 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
L549747 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...

L549656 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Annabelle...wake up honey...
L549625 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Maybe twenty.
L549624 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How many devilled eggs can you eat?
L549623 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh, yeh.
L549622 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ This'll work, huh?
L549618 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ This is a joke, right?
L549617 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
L549616 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You have to ignore him.
L549615 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
L549614 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And what do you do wh...
L549613 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Good girl.
L549612 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Not with my mouth open.
L549611 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
L549610 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ ...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
L549609 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You don't like his friends.
L549608 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
L549607 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Actually.  I could only help him.
L549606 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Great.
L549605 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I could help with the debate.
L549604 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
L549603 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What's Thursd...
L549573 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She is but an arriviste.
L549572 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
L549571 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And...?
L549570 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
L549564 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...I'm not deaf, y'know.
L549563 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I said...
L549562 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
L549561 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I can't hear you.
L549542 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
L549541 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
L549539 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
L549538 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
L549347 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Secret's safe with me.
L549346 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ And don't tell her I told you.
L549345 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I bet.
L549344 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
L549343 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ She knows every neat junk food place.
L549342 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Like a big sister.
L549341 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ ...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
L549337 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
L549336 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I hope it's the right kind.
L549330 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well.  It's for you.
L549329 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Wow.  Who's that for?
L549301 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I'll be there for you.
L549300 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That happens.  To families.
L549297 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
L549296 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Like how?
L549295 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
L549288 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
L549287 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
L549286 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Look she's upset --
L549254 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Or blush.  You look pale.
L549253 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
L549252 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
L549251 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
L549250 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Then why are you putting on mascara?
L549249 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
L549248 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ What are you gonna talk about?
L549247 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
L549187 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
L549186 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ So why are you asking me?
L549185 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Because it feels really incredibly good.
L549184 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...why do you think?
L549183 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
L549182 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I live.  In the same country.

L549180 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ During sex.
L549179 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Scream.
L549178 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Why does Rachel scream?
L549177 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, not exactly s...
L549176 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Sex.  Of course.
L549175 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
L549128 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
L549127 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
L548939 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
L548938 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I'm gonna call him.
L548935 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
L548934 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That will never happen.
L548933 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
L548932 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It happens.
L548931 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ It just slipped out.
L548929 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
L548928 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Like who?
L548927 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
L548926 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
L548925 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
L548924 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Mass hysteria.
L548923 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
L548922 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
L548921 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
L548920 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
L548865 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Excellent point.
L548864 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
L548860 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
L548859 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I hate when you say that.
L548858 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ <u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
L548853 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
L548852 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I don't care.
L548851 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
L549798 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
L549797 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ But Rache...
L549796 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
L549795 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
L549794 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ In high school.
L549793 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
L549792 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Uh.  What is it?
L549786 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
L549785 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Great.  Big ears, too?
L549784 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
L549783 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Help me here...
L549780 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
L549779 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Not use my words, please!
L549778 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
L549775 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
L549774 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
L549773 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
L549772 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
L549770 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.

L549735 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You think this is funny?
L549734 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ That doesn't bother me.
L549733 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That doesn't bother me.

L549326 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
L549171 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ MOMMY!
L549170 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
L549167 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
L549166 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...

L549086 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
L549085 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
L549084 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.

L548989 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
L548988 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Thank God for that!
L548987 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
L548982 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!

L548826 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
L548825 +++$+++ u7878 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ ANNABELLE +++$+++ You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
L549964 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.

L549000 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.

L548996 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ &quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
L548995 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
L548994 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I made you some cocoa.  See?
L548986 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Annabelle let's get something clear.
L548985 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Excuse me --
L548849 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No!
L548848 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --

L548844 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But you told us to starve.
L548841 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Alright starve.
L548840 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No.
L548839 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Then have a donut --
L548838 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You touched it.
L548837 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Fine.
L548836 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
L548835 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
L548834 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No.
L548833 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
L550051 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
L550050 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It's not good enough.
L550049 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
L550048 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
L550047 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
L550046 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ So where are you?
L550045 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
L550041 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Half.  Of him.
L550040 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But you can still see him.
L550039 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
L550036 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You dying.
L550035 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
L550030 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
L550029 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rache says it's from you.
L550028 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Find the bird cage?
L549808 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rache can do that part.
L549807 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
L549805 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I helped.
L549804 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Okay.  These are good.
L549648 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh.
L549647 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
L549646 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ How do you know?
L549645 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
L549644 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
L549643 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben where do you have to get to?
L549642 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Before you.
L549641 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Where Ben?
L549640 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No!  I have to get there.
L549639 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
L549567 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
L549566 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That's Rache's song!
L549565 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
L549535 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm still sick, but I'm better.
L549534 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ So you're okay.
L549529 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Is your bad?
L549528 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
L549526 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
L549525 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You have the WORST flu since...
L549524 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Mommy's sick, guys.
L549427 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Pray.  We never find out.
L549426 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No.
L549379 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
L549378 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
L549372 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thursday's fine...
L549371 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
L549368 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
L549367 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm fine, ba...
L549366 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Mom...?
L549365 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That I do.  Always will.
L549362 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
L549361 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
L549360 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
L549359 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yes.
L549358 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
L549357 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Where are you, anyway?
L549356 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
L549355 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Is that like Luigi's?
L549354 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
L549353 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ And many meatballs.
L549352 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
L549351 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
L549139 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ If you want me to hate her I will.
L549138 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What honey?
L549137 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Mommy?
L549136 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yes...if you like big hair...
L549135 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I think she's pretty, Mommy.
L549134 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
L549133 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Does Rachel make a lot of money?
L549132 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
L549131 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rachel's job is she works.
L549130 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
L549129 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
L549093 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I knew where I was all the time.
L549092 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
L548941 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
L548940 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Poof!  You're happy now.
L548937 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
L548936 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Queen of diamonds.
L548863 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
L548862 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I have lava.
L548861 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
L548855 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
L548854 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
L549162 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
L549161 +++$+++ u7880 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
L548874 +++$+++ u7880 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
L548873 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And when did that pass?
L548872 +++$+++ u7880 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --

L549237 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's necessary, huh?
L549236 +++$+++ u7881 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DR. SWEIKERT +++$+++ At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
L549235 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ So we'll...radiate some more?
L549234 +++$+++ u7881 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DR. SWEIKERT +++$+++ Every day.  More and more.
L549233 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
L549764 +++$+++ u7882 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
L549763 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.

L548875 +++$+++ u7882 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
L549533 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ A lot smaller.
L549532 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
L549518 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I live or I die.
L549517 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What happens next?
L549515 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
L549514 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We're going to win this.
L549513 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
L549423 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
L549422 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yet another spaghetti night.
L549421 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
L549420 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
L549418 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
L549417 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's temporary.
L549415 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Stop.  You're making me insecure.
L549414 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
L549279 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And we all went through that together?
L549278 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
L549277 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
L549276 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
L549275 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
L549274 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
L549273 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ WE are over.
L549272 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We...
L549271 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
L549270 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's a huge moment in their life --
L549269 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ To make it easier for them or you?
L549268 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
L549264 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just not to me.
L549263 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
L549262 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
L549261 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
L549259 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
L549258 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
L549257 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Still, please.
L549149 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And I'm supposed to care.
L549148 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm afraid she's going to walk.
L549147 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ <u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
L549146 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
L549145 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
L549144 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
L549143 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Don't do this.
L549142 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Called him.  We set an ap...
L549118 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
L549117 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
L549116 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
L549115 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
L549114 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Not to me.
L549113 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
L549112 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
L549111 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Our children.
L549076 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
L549075 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
L549074 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
L549073 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're WHERE?
L549072 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just outside the big top, we're almo...
L548919 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Good...Well...Take care.
L548918 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Easy enough.
L548917 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
L548916 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
L548915 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Me too.
L548914 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm worried.
L548913 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
L548912 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
L548911 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
L548910 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
L548909 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
L548905 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie, she was five minutes late --
L548904 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
L548903 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Napalm.
L548900 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
L548899 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
L548898 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
L548897 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We're not discussing your age.
L548896 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Rachel's not half my age.
L548895 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
L548894 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
L548891 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You think I didn't get that?
L548890 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Something's up wi...
L548889 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
L548888 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Because you don't really seem here.
L548887 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm here.
L548886 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Are you here?
L548884 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Remarried.  There is no move.
L548883 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Planning on getting --
L550026 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
L550025 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
L550022 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
L550021 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
L550010 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have their past.
L550009 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
L550008 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You'll learn.
L550007 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You ride with Annabelle...
L550006 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're the hip and fresh.
L550005 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
L550004 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What do I have that you don't?
L550003 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
L549999 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Uh.  You hate my guts?
L549998 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Why didn't I?
L549997 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
L549996 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Ben never mentioned it.
L549995 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
L549994 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
L549993 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I lost him.  I was panicked.
L549992 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're lying.
L549986 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Maybe I was wrong on that one.
L549985 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
L549984 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
L549983 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
L549982 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
L549980 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
L549979 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, there isn't.
L549978 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
L549977 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
L549976 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
L549975 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Double.
L549974 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She likes a Stolie, no ice.
L549972 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Neutral ground.  What's up?
L549971 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thanks for coming out.
L549928 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ <u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
L549927 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
L549926 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
L549925 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
L549924 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
L549923 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
L549922 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
L549921 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
L549920 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh please.
L549919 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
L549917 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
L549916 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You weren't passing 'em out.
L549915 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
L549914 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That's not wh...
L549913 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
L549912 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
L549911 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
L549910 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Worked.  Like a charm.
L549909 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
L549908 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Aw.
L549907 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You put filth in my child's mouth.
L549906 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
L549905 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
L549904 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
L549903 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
L549902 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Give 'em my number.
L549901 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...

L549899 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
L549898 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Don't be too sure.
L549897 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And I'm going to win.
L549896 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Are we.
L549895 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
L549893 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?

L549891 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
L549890 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
L549846 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
L549845 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Is that what he told you?
L549844 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
L549838 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
L549837 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And her...?
L549836 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
L549832 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Feeling the pressure?
L549831 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ My advice to you?  Don't die.
L549828 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
L549827 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
L549826 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
L549825 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
L549824 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's the same choice you made.
L549823 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
L549822 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
L549821 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You mean, after I'm dead?
L549820 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
L549819 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
L549818 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's just not the right time t...
L549816 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No.
L549815 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
L549810 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...go to the park.  In the worst way.
L549809 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
L549727 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
L549726 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
L549725 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thanks, but it's under control.
L549724 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
L549723 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How's she doing with Brad?
L549722 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
L549721 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
L549701 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
L549700 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And you said...
L549699 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
L549697 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
L549696 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The primo stuff is great for pain.
L549694 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Brad Kovitsky.
L549693 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
L549691 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
L549690 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
L549689 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I really look like shit.
L549688 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
L549687 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ So.  Hopeful.
L549683 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
L549682 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Can I look at the pictures?
L549598 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Beats me.  Ask your mom.
L549597 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And you said...?
L549594 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
L549593 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She's devastated.
L549592 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
L549591 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh, my God.
L549590 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
L549589 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
L549588 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
L549587 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
L549586 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Moi?
L549585 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
L549584 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She hasn't mentioned this.
L549583 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
L549582 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're a cross-dresser.
L549581 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ So I have to tell you something in confidence...
L549580 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
L549579 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Small world.
L549505 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ironic, huh?
L549504 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Okay, I'm undeserving.
L549503 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
L549502 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ See, I know that.
L549501 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They came out of my <u>body</u>!
L549498 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
L549497 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
L549495 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How would you know <u>anything</u>?
L549494 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I don't, but...
L549493 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How the hell would you know?
L549492 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You bet you are.
L549490 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're not dying.
L549489 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
L549483 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
L549482 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
L549481 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ...it's my problem, too.
L549480 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
L549479 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Luke.  Can't live like that.
L549478 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Did I hear the word...
L549477 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ We can't live like that.
L549476 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
L549472 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ But I came here to...
L549471 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Nobody likes a snoop.
L549470 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
L549469 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Don't flatter yourself.
L549468 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Look, you've never liked me...
L549467 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
L549466 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You WHAT?
L549465 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
L549464 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ My boss.
L549463 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.

L549404 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
L549403 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
L549402 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
L549401 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
L549399 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Wowie.  How wonderful!
L549398 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
L549395 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
L549394 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You feeling all right?
L549392 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
L549391 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yes?
L549390 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Jackie?
L549389 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She was angry at herself.
L549388 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
L549387 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Anxiety.
L549386 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What about obsessively picking her split ends?
L549334 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
L549333 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
L549332 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm sorry, I just...
L549324 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
L549323 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
L549213 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
L549212 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Not personally.
L549211 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
L549210 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Why not just bring the whole toilet?
L549209 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
L549208 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Fine, forget it.
L549207 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
L549206 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ However many.  It's not enough.
L549205 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
L549204 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
L549202 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I did it for her.

L549200 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
L549199 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I need practice.
L549198 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
L549197 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
L549196 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
L549195 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
L549194 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I have a snoop.
L549192 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I don't recall inviting you.
L549191 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
L549190 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ...in.
L549124 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
L549123 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
L549122 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
L549110 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
L549109 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
L549105 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
L549104 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
L549079 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
L549078 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yeh?
L549068 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
L549067 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Look, I...
L549066 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Machines do not EAT message.
L549034 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You got to hell!
L549033 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ But it's not on the schedule!
L549032 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Get out!
L549031 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
L549030 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
L549029 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
L549028 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
L549027 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
L549026 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
L549025 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I was in there in him.
L549024 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
L549023 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
L549021 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ <u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
L549020 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
L549019 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
L549017 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
L549016 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What did you do?
L549015 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
L549014 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
L549013 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Annabelle, how's your video rep...
L549012 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
L549011 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We don't have any coffee.
L549010 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Can I please have a cup of coffee?
L549009 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
L549008 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
L549007 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
L549888 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm gonna get me a drink.
L549887 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Where you goin'?
L549883 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
L549882 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
L549880 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Because you've changed so much.
L549879 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's not us.
L549878 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ 'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
L549877 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
L549876 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
L549872 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
L549871 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ '...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
L549870 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
L549869 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Restless.
L549868 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ By way of saying you were unhappy.
L549867 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I told her I loved her.
L549866 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
L549865 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Can we go sit somewhere?
L549864 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
L549863 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
L549862 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ '...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
L549861 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
L549860 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I needed some time away.
L549859 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
L549858 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why in the world would she t...
L549857 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
L549856 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, they will be.
L549855 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
L549851 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
L549850 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What a great surpri...
L549709 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
L549708 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No problem.
L549559 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know that.
L549558 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ She's not gonna die.
L549557 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
L549556 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ They're my kids.
L549554 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
L549553 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
L549552 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's just an assignment.
L549551 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's no biggie.
L549550 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
L549312 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
L549311 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Rache, it may take time.
L549310 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
L549308 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
L549307 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
L549306 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's forever you know.
L549305 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I think so too...
L549304 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I think so...What do you think?
L549303 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh my God.  Are you serious?
L549121 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...

L549119 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
L549056 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
L549055 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
L549054 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We have the kids.  Next weekend.

L549052 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Not yet.
L549051 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
L549050 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
L548975 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
L548974 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
L548973 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
L548972 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
L548971 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
L548970 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Nobody's telling them to hate you --
L548969 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
L548968 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ They don't hate you --
L548967 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Look.  I know they hate me.
L548966 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
L548965 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
L548964 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ But?  But what?
L548963 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I trust you of course I do but --
L548962 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You don't trust me to be alone with them.
L548961 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
L548960 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
L548959 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
L548958 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
L548957 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ For what?
L548956 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
L548954 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Jesus.
L548953 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We have the kids this weekend, so...
L548952 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ So I'll have to order in?
L548951 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
L548950 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yeh, it's cheaper.
L548949 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You'd rather spoil our walk home.
L548948 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I didn't want to spoil our supper...
L548947 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
L548946 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We have to talk.
L548945 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
L548944 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
L548943 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It was a veal stock, I thi...
L548942 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
L549433 +++$+++ u7886 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
L549432 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
L549431 +++$+++ u7886 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
L549430 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
L549429 +++$+++ u7886 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Does Jackie know this?
L549428 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
