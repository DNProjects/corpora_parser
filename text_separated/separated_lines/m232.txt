L10343 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You done impressing yourself, ace?
L10257 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
L10256 +++$+++ u3527 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ ONE NIGHT +++$+++ She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
L10255 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
L10254 +++$+++ u3527 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ ONE NIGHT +++$+++ Okay, good reason.  Then what?
L10253 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
L10252 +++$+++ u3527 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ ONE NIGHT +++$+++ Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
L10251 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
L10250 +++$+++ u3527 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ ONE NIGHT +++$+++ Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
L10242 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Where're you?
L10241 +++$+++ u3527 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ ONE NIGHT +++$+++ Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
L10212 +++$+++ u3527 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ ONE NIGHT +++$+++ Piece of cake, baby.
L10211 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
L10191 +++$+++ u3527 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ ONE NIGHT +++$+++ I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
L10190 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
L10267 +++$+++ u3528 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What is that?  You drop your dive light?
L10266 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nice shot, Lins.
L10227 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
L10226 +++$+++ u3528 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
L10145 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
L10144 +++$+++ u3528 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You got it?!  You got it?
L10121 +++$+++ u3528 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I'm alright, I'm dealing.
L10120 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How you guys doing?
L9939 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
L9938 +++$+++ u3528 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ She-hit.
L10380 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
L10379 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
L10135 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ Yeah, okay.  Okay.
L10134 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
L10133 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
L10132 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm taking you back out.
L10131 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
L10130 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
L10129 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey, you okay?
L10128 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ Lord Almighty.
L10127 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
L10126 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ Where are we?
L10081 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ How deep's the drop-off here?
L10080 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Okay so far.
L9937 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
L9936 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ What's goin' on, Boss?
L9920 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
L9919 +++$+++ u3524 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ JAMMER +++$+++ Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
L10587 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
L10586 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Hello, Brigman.
L10492 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who then?
L10491 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No, Bud, no... not you.
L10489 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
L10488 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ 'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
L10487 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
L10486 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hi, lady.
L10485 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
L10458 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Tell me later.
L10457 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh God, Lins... I--
L10455 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
L10454 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It is insane.
L10452 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
L10451 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
L10450 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's the plan?
L10449 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
L10448 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ FUCK LOGIC!!
L10447 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
L10446 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
L10445 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
L10444 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
L10443 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
L10442 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Alright, put this on.
L10441 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
L10440 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
L10439 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
L10438 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
L10437 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ We've only got one suit.
L10436 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't know how!
L10435 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ How?
L10434 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
L10433 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Calm down, Bud.
L10432 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Son of a bitch!
L10430 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I don't know, look around.
L10429 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
L10428 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
L10427 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You see where it's coming in?
L10426 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
L10425 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ They'll come out after us.
L10424 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good hundred yards, I'd say.
L10422 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
L10421 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Well, that's that.
L10420 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
L10419 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Try again.
L10417 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You noticed.
L10416 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
L10415 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Yeah.  So sue me.
L10414 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You totaled it, huh?
L10413 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not in this thing.
L10412 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
L10411 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
L10409 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
L10408 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You owe me one, Virgil.
L10386 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
L10385 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
L10384 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
L10383 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Now what?
L10382 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He's jammed the mechanism.
L10346 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
L10345 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
L10339 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ It's trying to communicate.
L10338 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I think it likes you.
L10327 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
L10326 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ He's got the shakes?
L10320 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Chill out, Lindsey!!
L10319 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You dumb jarhead motherf--
L10311 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Lindsey!  Wait a second--
L10310 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
L10292 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
L10291 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
L10290 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
L10289 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
L10288 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No.
L10287 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
L10286 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
L10285 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
L10284 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
L10283 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
L10282 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
L10281 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, something really important is happening here.
L10280 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Jesus, Lindsey--
L10270 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
L10269 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ If you say so.  It could be anything.
L10268 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
L10240 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Yeah?  Well I'm not.
L10239 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
L10238 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
L10237 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
L10236 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
L10235 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about O-2?
L10234 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
L10233 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Need some help?
L10232 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
L10231 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's the scoop, ace?
L10185 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Cute, Virgil.
L10184 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
L10166 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
L10165 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What do you think he saw?
L10164 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ But what did he see that made him panic?
L10163 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
L10162 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
L10161 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
L10160 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No.
L10159 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
L10158 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
L10157 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Fine.  Be that way.
L10156 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
L10155 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
L10043 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
L10042 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
L10041 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
L10040 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What happened?
L10039 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
L10038 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
L10037 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
L10036 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
L10035 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I haven't worn mine in months.
L10034 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
L10033 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ What are you still wearing that for?
L10030 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
L10029 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
L10028 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
L10027 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ That must be it.
L10026 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I think you were worried about me.
L10025 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
L10024 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You wanna know what I think?
L10023 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
L10022 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
L10020 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
L10019 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
L10016 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who else?
L10015 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
L10014 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You never did like being called that, did you?
L10013 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not for long.
L10012 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
L9970 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
L9969 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm switching off now.
L9968 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
L9967 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
L9966 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
L9965 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your rig?
L9964 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
L9963 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wasn't up to me.
L9962 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
L9961 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
L9960 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I can't believe you let them do this!
L10229 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ No.
L10228 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Did you find Wilhite?
L10210 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
L10209 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
L10116 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Let's go, guys.
L10115 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ We'll go in through that large breach.
L10059 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
L10058 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
L10057 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ I can't afford slack, Brigman.
L10056 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
L10053 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
L10052 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
L10474 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All right.  Do it!
L10473 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
L10472 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Is that it?  Is this right?
L10466 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
L10465 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Got it. Over.
L10464 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
L10325 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
L10324 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
L10309 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
L10308 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why bring it here?
L10307 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Come on, man.  What else could it be?
L10247 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
L10246 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Do we just leave him there?
L10245 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
L10244 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ That's Perry.
L10188 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Everything is.
L10187 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
L10186 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
L10181 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
L10180 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L10098 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
L10097 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
L9974 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
L9973 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ God, I hate that bitch.
L9972 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Virgil?
L10389 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ I can't... make it... podner.
L10388 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
L10302 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
L10301 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Yuh?
L10300 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ 'Fish'?
L10141 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
L10140 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He's convulsing!
L10123 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ We're here now.  Let's get her done.
L10122 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
L9918 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
L9917 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey, you guys are milking that job.
L10583 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
L10582 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
L10358 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
L10357 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
L10272 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
L10271 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Y'all could be more specific.
L10265 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Missed what?
L10264 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You better not say you missed that.
L10249 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ You watch yourself.
L10248 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
L9993 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
L9992 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
L9991 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
L10401 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Give me that!!
L10400 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ SHIT!
L10348 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
L10347 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
L10277 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
L10276 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Are we talkin' little space friend here?
L10169 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Turn it up, bozo.
L10168 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Quiet!  Quiet!
L10051 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
L10050 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Hippy, you pussy.
L10002 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
L10001 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
L10315 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
L10314 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
L10313 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
L10312 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
L10295 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
L10294 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
L10108 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
L10107 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ 24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
L10106 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ How many are there?
L10105 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
L10094 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Copy that.
L10093 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
L10092 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
L10089 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Wilhite, anything?
L10088 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Neutron counter's not showing very much.
L10087 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Cab One, radiation readings?
L10085 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
L10084 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Cab One, do you see it yet?
L10000 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
L9999 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
L9996 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
L9995 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
L9994 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
L9980 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
L9979 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
L10517 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ What kind of luminous things, Bud?
L10516 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Uh, oh...
L10515 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
L10514 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ 12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
L10392 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
L10391 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
L10374 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
L10373 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
L10334 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
L10333 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
L10331 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
L10330 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
L10329 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
L10275 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
L10274 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ A non-terrestrial intelligence.
L10183 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
L10182 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Figured that out for yourself, did you?
L10078 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
L10077 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ 1840... 50... 60... 70...
L10076 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ What's you depth, Cab Three?
L10075 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
L9988 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
L9987 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
L10366 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ What's the timer set for?
L10365 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
L10113 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
L10112 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ Getting a reading?
L10103 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
L10102 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ Stand by on the ROV.
L10069 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ Check this out.
L10068 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Hey!
L10065 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
L10064 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ How deep?
L10063 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
L10540 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
L10539 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Would we see the flash?
L10535 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ He's hallucinating badly.
L10534 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ What kind of light?
L10529 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
L10528 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ He can still make it.
L10520 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
L10519 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
L10506 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
L10505 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
L10504 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ 8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
L10502 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
L10501 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ 4800 feet.  It's official.
L9998 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
L9997 +++$+++ u3526 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ MONK +++$+++ High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
