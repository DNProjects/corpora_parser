L157704 +++$+++ u4774 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
L157701 +++$+++ u4774 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ To fucking Mutt.
L157700 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Actually I don't really know Mutt.
L157699 +++$+++ u4774 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
L157695 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Actually I don't
L157694 +++$+++ u4774 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
L157693 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
L157684 +++$+++ u4775 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
L157683 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
L157682 +++$+++ u4775 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ They're townies?!
L157681 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't think they're in school.
L157680 +++$+++ u4775 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Do they go to Henley Hall?
L157439 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Knox?
L157438 +++$+++ u4775 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I'm in as long as we're careful.
L157427 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, no shit, Sherlock
L157426 +++$+++ u4775 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
L157425 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So don't goddam come!  Please.
L157424 +++$+++ u4775 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You know how many demerits we're talking?
L157423 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't come.
L157422 +++$+++ u4775 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Sounds boring to me.
L157943 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I'll tell you later.
L157942 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you mean you don't know?
L157939 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Yep.
L157938 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
L157622 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
L157621 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What is the point?
L157620 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
L157619 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So you really think she means you're going with her?
L157618 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ So?
L157617 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well?
L157616 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Yeah.
L157615 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ At Chet Danburry's house.
L157614 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
L157601 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
L157600 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Knox, you gotta calm down.
L157599 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
L157518 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
L157517 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
L157516 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
L157465 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, this is great.
L157464 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
L157444 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ But why?
L157443 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Women swoon!
L157442 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ It will?  How do you figure?
L157441 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
L157440 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't get it.
L157395 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ What is the Dead Poets Society?
L157394 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
L157365 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
L157364 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How was dinner?
L157271 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
L157270 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
L157245 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Knox Overstreet.
L157244 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Charlie Dalton.
L157758 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Garden?
L157757 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
L157458 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This is it.
L157457 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
L157456 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
L157437 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Except sex.
L157436 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ All right.  I'll try anything once.
L157320 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
L157319 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
L157251 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And English, and trig
L157250 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
L157249 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
L157248 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
L157957 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So much the better.
L157956 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
L157899 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I couldn't stop myself.
L157898 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
L157715 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
L157714 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
L157713 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Why? Nobody knows who we are.
L157712 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Oh God, it's over now!
L157677 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
L157676 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
L157523 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It should, but I found it and now I claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  Seize the cave.
L157522 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
L157521 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
L157431 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh come on, Pitts...
L157430 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Well...
L157890 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I, we
L157889 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
L157825 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
L157824 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes sir.
L157823 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
L157822 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah?  Like what?
L157821 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But I thought-
L157820 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
L157819 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
L157818 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
L157817 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Mr. Keating!
L157472 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
L157471 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I here and now commit myself to daring!
L157778 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
L157777 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ "O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
L157776 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Don't stop.
L157775 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
L157774 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Nuwanda?  Please?
L157773 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
L157772 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But...
L157771 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
L157770 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm not?
L157769 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
L157768 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?
L157767 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You know what really excites me about you?
L157766 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I think you're sweet.
L157765 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I think he's sweet.
L157717 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
L157716 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That's right, it's Nuwanda.
L157709 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
L157708 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
L157661 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Isn't he precious?
L157660 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I told you, that's a secret.
L157659 +++$+++ u4779 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
L157795 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
L157794 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
L157793 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
L157792 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes... sir.
L157791 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
L157787 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
L157786 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
L157785 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Who else was involved in this?
L157782 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ what?!
L157781 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
L157403 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
L157402 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
L157215 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
L157214 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Doing fine, sir.
L157213 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
L157881 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's better than doing nothing.
L157880 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ This is stupid.
L157879 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
L157878 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
L157877 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What good will that do?
L157876 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
L157802 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
L157801 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What are you going to do? - Charlie?
L157800 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
L157799 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What happened?
L157798 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No.
L157797 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What happened? Were you kicked out?
L157719 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
L157718 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
L157711 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
L157710 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You what?!  How did you do that?
L157679 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
L157678 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Where'd you find them?
L157675 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
L157674 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Nuwanda, what is going on?
L157673 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's Nuwanda.
L157672 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Charlie...
L157598 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
L157597 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
L157463 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ To put the rout all that was not life.  And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  Pledge Overstreet.
L157462 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ All right.  I'll second that.
L157461 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
L157429 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm in.
L157428 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Who's in?
L157283 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're welcome to join us, Todd.
L157282 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Sure.
L157281 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
L157276 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
L157275 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
L157247 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
L157246 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
L157241 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's not my fault.
L157240 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Hey, he's your roommate.
L157239 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
L157238 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
L157237 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
L157236 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
L157235 +++$+++ u4776 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
L157750 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
L157749 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ You fucked up little prick!
L157746 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox?!
L157745 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ What are you doing?!
L157743 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Chet...
L157742 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Stop what?
L157741 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Don't stop.
L157740 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You know,
L157739 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ It does?  What?
L157738 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
L157358 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
L157357 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
L157347 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
L157346 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ It's all right, Chet.
L158005 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ It's just for a little while. You promised.
L158004 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I have to go home. Chet might call.
L157986 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ My Word
L157985 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What is that?
L157984 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Dead Poets honor.
L157983 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
L157982 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
L157981 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ God, if Chet found out he'd...
L157980 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
L157979 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L157978 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
L157977 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, you are so infuriating!
L157976 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Then come with me.
L157975 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
L157974 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Are you going with Chet?
L157973 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
L157972 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
L157971 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
L157970 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
L157969 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Just like that?!  You just knew?
L157968 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
L157966 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
L157965 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ But I love you.
L157964 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
L157963 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
L157962 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
L157961 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
L157960 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ You can't be in here.
L157959 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, why are you doing this to me?
L157958 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Chris!
L157935 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
L157934 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, I don't believe this!
L157931 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, you're crazy.
L157930 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
L157929 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
L157927 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox!  what are you doing here?
L157926 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Chris!
L157736 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Huh?
L157735 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
L157671 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
L157670 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ But, Chris...
L157669 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
L157668 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ No.
L157667 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
L157613 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I'll be there.  The Danburrys.  Friday night.  Thank you, Chris.
L157612 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
L157611 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Well, sure!
L157610 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ You are?  She's glad I called!
L157609 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
L157608 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
L157607 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hello?
L157353 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
L157352 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Sort of.
L157351 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ That's your sister school, right?
L157350 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
L157349 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ So, uh, where are you in school?
L157342 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ The pleasure is mine.
L157341 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.
L157872 +++$+++ u4780 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ HAGER +++$+++ That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
L157871 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Yes sir.
L157870 +++$+++ u4780 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ HAGER +++$+++ Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
L157869 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
L157868 +++$+++ u4780 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ HAGER +++$+++ What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
L157867 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
L158007 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ "We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
L158006 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
L157833 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
L157832 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
L157557 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
L157556 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
L157385 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
L157384 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
L157310 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
L157309 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Meeks.
L157308 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Very good, Mr._?
L157307 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Carpe Diem... seize the day.
L157306 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
L157814 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
L157813 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
L157812 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
L157811 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
L157810 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
L157809 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Courtyard?
L157808 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
L157807 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
L157806 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
L157805 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ I didn't know you taught.
L157804 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
L158009 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I have something.
L158008 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Come on boys, don't be shy.
L157589 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
L157588 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Don't stop!
L157587 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
L157585 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
L157584 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
L157583 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
L157582 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ A sweaty-toothed madman
L157581 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
L157580 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
L157579 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
L157578 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
L157577 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A crazy madman.
L157576 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
L157575 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A madman.
L157574 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
L157573 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
L157572 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ AHHHHHH!
L157571 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ LOUDER!
L157570 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ YAWP!
L157569 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Again!  Louder!
L157568 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Yawp!
L157567 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Good god, boy! Yell!
L157566 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ A barbaric yawp.
L157565 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A yawp?
L157948 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
L157947 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
L157946 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yeah.
L157945 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
L157914 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
L157913 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Isn't there an easier way?
L157912 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
L157911 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
L157910 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
L157909 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
L157908 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
L157907 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
L157906 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
L157905 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
L157904 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
L157903 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
L157902 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
L157901 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
L157900 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
L157893 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
L157892 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Okay.
L157891 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
L157414 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
L157413 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
L157407 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Nothing wrong with research.
L157406 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I was just looking in an old annual and...
L157405 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
L157404 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
L157941 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I don't know.
L157940 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ All right!  What'd she say?
L157923 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
L157922 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ She won't even see me, Pitts.
L157921 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
L157920 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
L157376 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ You have another choice.
L157375 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ You really think I should forget her?
L157371 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
L157370 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
L157369 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
L157368 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Too bad.
L157603 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I'm calling her!
L157602 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Where are you going?
L157515 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
L157514 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
L157367 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
L157366 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
L157326 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
L157325 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
L157278 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
L157277 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
L157274 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
L157273 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
L157525 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Good luck.
L157524 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
L157469 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
L157468 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
L157433 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Then you can help him.
L157432 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ His grades are hurting, Charlie.
L157397 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Nothing.  No mention of it.
L157396 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Any group pictures in the annual?
L157280 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
L157279 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
L157861 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L157860 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
L157859 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
L157858 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
L157857 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
L157856 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
L157855 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Father, I--
L157854 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
L157853 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Father!
L157269 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
L157268 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You know me, always taking on too much.
L157267 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L157266 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
L157265 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
L157264 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
L157263 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Father, I wasn't disputing you.
L157262 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
L157261 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
L157260 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But father, it's not fair.
L157259 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Neil.
L157258 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But father, I'm assistant editor.
L157593 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ The god of the cave.
L157592 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ What is it?
L157591 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Look at this.
L157435 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
L157434 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ What is this, a midnight study group?
L157421 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ That's miles.
L157420 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
L157419 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Where is this cave he's talking about?
L157418 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
L157316 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But different.
L157315 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Weird.
L157875 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I don't know.
L157874 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Do you have to quit the play?
L157873 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Visit from my father.
L157852 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
L157851 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
L157850 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Put more into it!
L157849 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Yea, art thou there?
L157848 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Chicken shit.  Where were we?
L157847 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I'll come to the performance.
L157846 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
L157845 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ No thanks.
L157844 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
L157842 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
L157841 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ This play?
L157840 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
L157839 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I will be with thee straight.
L157838 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
L157642 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
L157641 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
L157640 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ what?
L157639 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
L157638 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
L157637 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
L157636 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Oh. 
L157635 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Oh..
L157634 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
L157633 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
L157632 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
L157631 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ It's my birthday.
L157630 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Todd, what's the matter?
L157552 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Quiet.  I have to think.
L157551 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Neil, you're not gonna...
L157550 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ From my father and Nolan.
L157549 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ From you?
L157548 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
L157547 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Neil, how are you gonna do this?
L157512 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ No.
L157511 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ No?  What do you mean 'no'?
L157510 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Er  No.
L157509 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
L157508 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
L157507 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
L157506 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
L157505 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
L157504 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
L157503 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ What is that supposed to mean?
L157502 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
L157501 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I guess.
L157500 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
L157499 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
L157498 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ But if he said no before then...
L157497 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
L157496 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
L157495 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
L157494 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Come on, that's impossible.
L157493 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
L157492 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
L157491 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
L157490 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
L157489 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
L157488 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ And now he will?
L157487 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
L157486 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ So?
L157485 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
L157484 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
L157483 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ A play, dummy.
L157482 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
L157481 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
L157480 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Found what?
L157479 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I've found it.
L157455 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
L157454 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
L157453 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What?
L157452 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I don't want to read.
L157451 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
L157450 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Yes.  But
L157449 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
L157448 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I... I just don't want to come.
L157447 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What is it then?
L157329 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Thanks but  I'd better do history.
L157328 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Want to come to the study group?
L157290 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
L157289 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Nothing.
L157288 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What?
L157287 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I'll take him over mine.
L157286 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ So what do you think of my father?
L157232 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I don't.
L157231 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
L157230 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
L157229 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Oh, so you're that Anderson.
L157228 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ My brother went here.
L157227 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Why'd you leave Balincrest?
L157226 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Todd Anderson.
L157225 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
