L175307 +++$+++ u4944 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ HOST +++$+++ "Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
L175306 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Uh, beg to differ.
L175305 +++$+++ u4944 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ HOST +++$+++ Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
L175304 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ It is my home.
L175303 +++$+++ u4944 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ HOST +++$+++ Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
L175302 +++$+++ u4944 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ HOST +++$+++ Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
L175301 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Greetings.  I am the Count.
L175830 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I predict we're lost.
L175829 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
L175619 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
L175618 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No.
L175617 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
L175616 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
L175615 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
L175323 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No.  I never drink -- wine.
L175322 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
L175315 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
L175314 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ It's a pleasure...
L175313 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
L175866 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No problem.  I know it by heart...
L175865 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
L175864 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
L175863 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
L175862 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, she's really somethin'.
L175861 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
L175860 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
L175859 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Last night was quite a romp.
L175833 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Has anyone ever been to Downey?
L175832 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Sorry...
L175797 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Perfect.
L175796 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, how was I?
L175795 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And, cut...
L175793 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's great.  Let's do a take.
L175792 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
L175791 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
L175790 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Oh.  So what is the scene about?
L175789 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
L175788 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
L175781 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Soon, Bela... Soon.
L175780 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
L175779 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
L175778 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Really?  I don't feel so great.
L175777 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
L175762 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
L175761 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
L175760 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
L175759 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What happened?!
L175735 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
L175734 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
L175733 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry.
L175731 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Formaldehyde.
L175730 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
L175729 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
L175728 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
L175727 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
L175726 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't you have any savings?
L175725 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
L175724 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
L175723 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I was thinking about killing myself.
L175722 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What are you doing?
L175721 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
L175720 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
L175719 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
L175718 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Why are you here??
L175609 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
L175608 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, this is quite a scene.
L175607 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
L175606 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
L175605 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
L175604 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
L175603 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
L175597 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
L175596 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Don't let me slow you down.
L175595 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
L175594 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.
L175593 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?
L175592 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
L175591 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
L175590 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
L175589 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
L175588 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Once you're in it, it warms up.
L175587 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Goddamn, it's cold!
L175586 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Oh, for Christ's sake.
L175585 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
L175584 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
L175583 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You'll be fighting with the octopus.
L175582 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
L175576 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
L175575 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
L175503 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
L175502 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But maybe not.
L175501 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
L175500 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So why didn't you do it?
L175499 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
L175498 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really?
L175497 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
L175496 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, I did.
L175495 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, you screwed up.
L175494 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
L175493 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
L175492 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
L175488 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
L175487 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What is this place?
L175485 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
L175484 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
L175429 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
L175428 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
L175427 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
L175423 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
L175422 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
L175421 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You'll be sitting on the right.
L175420 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
L175419 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Mmph?  Where am I?
L175418 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, are you ready?
L175353 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ We didn't make a dime.
L175352 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ So how'd we do?
L175351 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Goodbye!  Goodbye!
L175312 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
L175311 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I never said I could ad-lib...
L175310 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
L175294 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
L175293 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
L175292 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
L175291 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ "Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
L175290 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "It is my home."
L175289 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ "Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
L175288 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "Greetings.  I am the Count."
L175278 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry.  I'll do something.
L175277 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
L175276 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What's in the needle?
L175275 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know how to make goulash.
L175274 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Goulash.
L175273 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
L175272 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Nah.  This happens all the time...
L175271 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Should I call a doctor?
L175270 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
L175269 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Let me take you to the hospital.
L175268 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I didn't feel well...
L175267 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, what happened?!
L175191 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
L175190 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Ah!  This is very exciting.
L175189 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
L175188 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Dracula?
L175187 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
L175186 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
L175185 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
L175184 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
L175183 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
L175182 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Of course!
L175181 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
L175180 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
L175179 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ That's good.  I could use the money.
L175178 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
L175177 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
L175176 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
L175175 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Who do I play?
L175174 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
L175173 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
L175172 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
L175127 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
L175126 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
L175125 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
L175124 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
L175115 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
L175114 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
L175113 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
L175112 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I am always on time.
L175111 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
L175058 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
L175057 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Ah, so I pull the strings!
L175056 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
L175055 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L175054 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
L175053 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
L175052 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
L175051 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
L175050 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
L175049 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
L175022 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
L175021 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Are you sure this is okay?
L175013 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
L175012 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Do you want me to get it for you?
L175011 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
L175010 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
L175009 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey Bela, how do you do that?
L175008 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
L175007 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
L175006 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
L174982 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
L174981 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
L174980 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
L174978 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
L174977 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I never thought of that.
L174976 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
L174975 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The <u>women</u>?
L174974 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
L174973 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
L174972 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
L174971 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
L174970 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But you're a big star!
L174969 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
L174968 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
L174967 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I have no next picture.
L174966 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
L174965 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
L174964 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't you bave a car?
L174963 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
L174962 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
L174961 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
L174960 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Thank you.
L174959 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
L174958 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
L174957 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
L174956 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
L174955 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really?
L174954 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Because I'm planning on dying soon.
L174953 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why were you buying a coffin?
L174952 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Ha!
L174951 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
L174950 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Who are you?  What do you want?
L174949 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Huh?
L174948 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  I don't work here.
L174947 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
L174946 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
L175392 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ If you say so.
L175391 +++$+++ u4935 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ You mean a Tesla coil?
L175390 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
L175240 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
L175239 +++$+++ u4935 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
L175238 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I've never seen anything like him!
L175235 +++$+++ u4935 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
L175234 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Jesus!  Are you serious?
L175233 +++$+++ u4935 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
L175232 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
L175231 +++$+++ u4935 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
L175230 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know.  Where?
L175229 +++$+++ u4935 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ So guess where I'm going next weekend?
L175414 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
L175413 +++$+++ u4936 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN BILL +++$+++ Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
L175404 +++$+++ u4936 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN BILL +++$+++ I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind.  But I like the dark gray one.
L175403 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What do you mean?
L175402 +++$+++ u4936 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN BILL +++$+++ Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
L175130 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sound!
L175129 +++$+++ u4936 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN BILL +++$+++ Rolling.
L175128 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Um, okay... roll camera
L175099 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What's to protect?  It was perfect!
L175098 +++$+++ u4936 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN BILL +++$+++ Don't you want a second take, for protection?
L175097 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
L175095 +++$+++ u4936 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN BILL +++$+++ Rolling.
L175094 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
L175574 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
L175573 +++$+++ u4937 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ This is kind of a stream--
L175572 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
L175338 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
L175337 +++$+++ u4937 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ These shoes are itchy.
L175336 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What do you think you're doin'?!
L175122 +++$+++ u4937 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
L175121 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
L174896 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
L174895 +++$+++ u4937 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ You really think so?
L174887 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This is the big moment...!
L174886 +++$+++ u4937 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
L175707 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
L175706 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
L175551 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
L175550 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
L175545 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
L175544 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
L175543 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
L175330 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
L175329 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's that easy?
L175328 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
L175327 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I made it up.  It's horseshit!
L175326 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't understand.
L175325 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I guessed.
L175324 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
L175321 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I'm Criswell.  I know all.
L175320 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ H-how'd you know?!
L175319 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
L175318 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Edward Wood, Sir.
L175317 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ And who may you be?
L175316 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Wow.
L175774 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
L175773 +++$+++ u4939 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
L175772 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Isn't he?
L175771 +++$+++ u4939 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
L175753 +++$+++ u4939 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ We'll do our best.
L175752 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Will he be okay?
L175751 +++$+++ u4939 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
L175750 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
L175634 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
L175633 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But you used to say --
L175632 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I'm tired of living on the fringe.
L175631 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Did you really mean those things you said..?
L175630 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
L175629 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dolores, wait!
L175541 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
L175540 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
L175539 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
L175538 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
L175530 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
L175529 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
L175528 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
L175527 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
L175526 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
L175524 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
L175523 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's right...
L175522 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
L175521 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
L175482 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Does she have room for me?
L175481 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I'm going to my mother's.
L175480 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
L175479 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ You're a fuckin' mess.
L175478 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
L175477 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
L175476 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
L175475 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
L175474 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
L175473 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I told you this was gonna happen.
L175472 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Goddamn landlord.
L175388 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
L175387 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Like <u>what</u>?!
L175386 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But there's plenty of other parts.
L175385 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
L175384 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
L175383 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
L175382 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It was the only way I could get the movie made!
L175362 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
L175361 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
L175360 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
L175359 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
L175358 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
L175357 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
L175356 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
L175284 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
L175283 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
L175282 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L175281 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
L175280 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
L175279 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm no good.
L175171 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Exactly.
L175170 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Toss us out on our ass.
L175169 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
L175168 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
L175167 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
L175166 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
L175165 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I don't know.  It's so much money...
L175164 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
L175155 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
L175154 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
L175138 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
L175137 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
L175136 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
L175135 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
L175075 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh, just like in the script!
L175074 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It takes me comfortable.
L175073 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ <u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
L175072 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's a damn good role.
L175071 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
L175070 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
L175069 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
L175068 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
L175067 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This is my way of telling you --
L175066 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
L175065 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
L175064 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ How long have you been doing this?
L175061 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
L175060 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
L174998 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ So did you get his autograph?
L174997 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
L174996 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
L174995 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
L174994 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I thought he was dead.
L174993 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
L174992 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ You met Basil Rathbone!
L174991 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
L174990 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Boris Karloff!?
L174989 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  A horror movie star!
L174988 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Who?  Robert Taylor?!
L174987 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
L174986 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Better than not getting a job?
L174985 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
L174984 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ You got the job?!!
L174983 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
L174921 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
L174920 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
L174901 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
L174900 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
L174899 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
L174898 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, it was only one review.
L174897 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
L174880 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
L174879 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ What?
L174878 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dolores, give me your shoes.
L175446 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
L175445 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
L175444 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What other sixty-thousand?
L175443 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
L175442 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
L175441 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I kinda need it now.
L175440 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  Exactly!
L175439 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
L175438 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
L175401 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
L175400 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Eddie, which dress do you like better?
L175378 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
L175377 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
L175376 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
L175375 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
L175374 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
L175373 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ For this one, we need $60,000.
L175372 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
L175371 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
L175368 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
L175367 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I understand you just moved here?
L175366 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
L175005 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, uh, if I could I would...
L175004 +++$+++ u4953 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ RUDE BOSS +++$+++ He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
L175003 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's not true --
L175002 +++$+++ u4953 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ RUDE BOSS +++$+++ Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
L175001 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
L175000 +++$+++ u4953 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ RUDE BOSS +++$+++ He's a <u>bum</u>.
L174905 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
L174904 +++$+++ u4953 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ RUDE BOSS +++$+++ Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
L175214 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
L175213 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
L175212 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
L175211 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But Bela Lugosi's in it!
L175210 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
L175209 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>Dr. Acula</u>!
L175208 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
L175207 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
L175206 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
L175205 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
L175204 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
L175203 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
L175202 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Really?!  Well good for you.
L175201 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
L175200 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
L175199 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
L175198 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
L175197 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
L176036 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
L176035 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Yes?
L176034 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mr. Reynolds!
L175999 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
L175998 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
L175997 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
L175996 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I like to think so.
L175995 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ "Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
L175994 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And PERFECT.  CUT!
L175986 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
L175985 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
L175910 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
L175909 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Just, it doesn't look like very much.
L175908 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
L175907 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ <u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?
L175906 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
L175905 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
L175904 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
L175903 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
L175902 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
L175901 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
L175900 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ "Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
L175899 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Absolutely!  You see this script..?
L175898 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Would that work?
L175897 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
L175896 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
L175895 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Raising money is tough.
L175894 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ <u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
L175893 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You could say that --
L175892 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
L175891 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
L175890 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
L175889 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah...?
L175888 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
L175887 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hruphh...?
L175886 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Mr. Wood?!
L175854 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ We're escaping!
L175853 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ What is happening?
L175828 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry.  We're almost there.
L175827 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ My eyes are killink me.
L175656 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
L175655 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But I thought me and Dolores had something.
L175654 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
L175653 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
L175652 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tor, I should be getting home.
L175645 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
L175644 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
L175643 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
L175642 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
L175641 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Hey!  You're not eatink.
L175425 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Okey-dokey.
L175424 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
L175399 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ But Greta say --
L175398 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
L175397 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
L175396 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
L175395 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
L175394 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really?  Was the third act too intense?
L175393 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
L175262 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
L175261 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ I like.  When do movie shoot?
L175260 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
L175254 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
L175253 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
L175252 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
L175251 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
L175250 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I think you're quite handsome.
L175249 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Mm, not good-lookink enough.
L175248 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
L175247 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Tor!
L175246 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So, Mr. Johnson --
L175245 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, of course!
L175244 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Could we moovf to table?
L175243 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Da pleasure be mine.
L175242 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
L176032 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
L176031 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
L176030 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
L176029 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
L176028 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ Ugh, I hate when that happens.
L176027 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
L176026 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
L176025 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
L176024 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
L176023 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
L176022 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
L176021 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
L176020 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ Yes?
L176019 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Excuse me, Sir...?
L175228 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ "Your movie"?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
L175227 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You can't talk that way about my movie.
L175226 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
L175225 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Maybe it needs special handling.
L175224 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
L175223 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why not??
L175222 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ "Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
L175158 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ I did.  I established some tits and ass.
L175157 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
L175152 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
L175151 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
L175150 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
L175149 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
L175148 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
L175147 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Um, I guess --
L175146 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
L175145 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
L175144 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
L175143 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
L175142 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
L175108 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
L175107 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ <u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
L175106 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
L175105 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
L175083 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
L175082 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
L175081 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't think he's a schmuck.
L175080 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
L175079 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ There's still a sex-change --
L175078 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
L175045 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
L175044 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
L175043 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
L175042 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ OUR picture?
L175041 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
L175040 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Isn't he dead?
L175039 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
L175038 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Lugosi?
L175037 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Who?
L175036 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
L175035 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
L175034 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
L175033 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Yeah.  Crap with a star.
L175032 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
L175031 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
L175030 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
L175029 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Tits.
L175028 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
L174940 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
L174939 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
L174938 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
L174937 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ You gotta be kiddin' me.
L174936 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
L174935 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ So you're not a fruit?
L174934 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
L174933 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Are you a fruit?
L174932 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
L174931 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
L174930 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
L174929 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
L174928 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
L174927 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Is there a script?
L174926 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
L174925 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So you're not gonna make the movie?
L174924 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
L174923 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
L174922 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Can I help you?
L176066 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
L176065 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
L176064 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
L176063 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Huh?!
L176062 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Let's get married.
L176061 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Ed, I'm so happy for you.
L176057 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ C'mon!  Let's just go.
L176056 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
L176055 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I can't get it to go up.
L175942 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ My chiropractor!
L175941 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who's Dr. Tom?
L175940 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
L175936 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
L175935 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
L175930 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah...  I should give her a call.
L175929 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ The poor girl's out of a job.
L175928 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Those assholes.
L175926 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
L175925 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ The sun.
L175924 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
L175923 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Dynamite --
L175922 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
L175921 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Uh, atomic energy?
L175920 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
L175919 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
L175918 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
L175885 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
L175884 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Well you tried --
L175883 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
L175882 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
L175881 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
L175877 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela died.
L175876 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ What was that?
L175873 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
L175872 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
L175857 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ STOP!
L175856 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Stop!
L175822 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay?
L175821 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.
L175820 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No! I love sex with girls.
L175819 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
L175818 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
L175817 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Huh?
L175816 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
L175815 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
L175814 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
L175813 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
L175811 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ "Dracula."
L175810 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What do you mean?
L175809 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
L175808 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
L175807 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
L175806 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
L175805 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Did you find it boring?
L175804 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
L175803 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
L175802 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ So have you always lived in L.A.?
L175801 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
L175800 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I just picked them up on the way over...
L175799 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
L175768 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Not good...
L175767 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
L175766 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I am.  How's your father?
L175765 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You look beat.
L175764 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, hi.
L175763 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Oh, it's you again.
L175749 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ This is my thirteenth pair.
L175748 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How long's he been here?
L175747 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
L175746 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What are you making?
L175745 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Oh.  My condolences.
L175744 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The marriage already ended.
L175743 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Oh.  Congratulations.
L175742 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I got married last night.
L175741 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
L175740 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hello.
L175948 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
L175947 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ What's uncanny?
L175946 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>It's uncanny</u>.
L175939 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
L175938 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You don't wanna be noticed?
L175937 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
L175934 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
L175933 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
L175932 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
L175931 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm really sorry...
L175826 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
L175825 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
L175824 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
L175465 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
L175464 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
L175463 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
L175462 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
L175461 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
L175460 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
L175459 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
L175458 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
L175457 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Yes?
L175456 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
L175916 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
L175915 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
L175914 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
L175913 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
L175912 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
L175704 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ So how long have you known Eddie?
L175703 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
L175581 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
L175580 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know, to make the legs move --
L175579 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ What octopus motor?
L175578 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
L175565 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ YES!  JUST DO IT!
L175564 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ You're <u>sure</u>???
L175563 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes!
L175562 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ You're sure this is gonna work?
L175553 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
L175552 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ Ed, you said you were getting permission.
L175417 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
L175416 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
L175415 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
L175365 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
L175364 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah...?
L175363 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
L175163 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
L175162 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
L175104 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
L175103 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ I don't know.
L175102 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
L174894 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
L174893 +++$+++ u4950 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ PAUL MARCO +++$+++ Lines around the block.
L174892 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
L176038 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
L176037 +++$+++ u4951 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REVEREND LEMON +++$+++ B-but it's our money --
L176011 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm directing.
L176010 +++$+++ u4951 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REVEREND LEMON +++$+++ Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
L176006 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ NOOOOO!!!
L176005 +++$+++ u4951 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REVEREND LEMON +++$+++ I thought this was a group effort.
L176004 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
L176003 +++$+++ u4951 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REVEREND LEMON +++$+++ This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
L175992 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!
L175991 +++$+++ u4951 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REVEREND LEMON +++$+++ Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
L175990 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
L175977 +++$+++ u4951 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REVEREND LEMON +++$+++ Mr. Wood!
L175976 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
L175960 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I do.
L175959 +++$+++ u4951 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REVEREND LEMON +++$+++ ...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
L175716 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
L175715 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
L175713 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
L175712 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What the heck is THIS?!!
L175710 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry, I'll teach you.
L175709 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
L175682 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
L175681 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
L175680 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know, you're a very attractive girl.
L175679 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Wow.
L175678 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
L175677 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
L175676 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
L175675 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What are you, an angora wholesaler?
L175674 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
L175673 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I suppose.  It's very expensive.
L175672 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
L175671 +++$+++ u4948 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Why... yes.
L175669 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
L175668 +++$+++ u4942 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED'S VOICE +++$+++ No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
L175667 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Isn't that the same thing?
L175666 +++$+++ u4942 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED'S VOICE +++$+++ ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
L175665 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
L175664 +++$+++ u4942 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
L175663 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Oh.  Yeah.  You.
L175662 +++$+++ u4942 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED'S VOICE +++$+++ Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
L175661 +++$+++ u4955 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ VAMPIRA +++$+++ Who?
L175660 +++$+++ u4942 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED'S VOICE +++$+++ Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
