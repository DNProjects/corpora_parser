L411821 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
L411437 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh. I forgot.
L411436 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
L411435 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What?
L411378 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ I'm late for lab.
L411377 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Right. 7:30.
L411376 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
L411374 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
L411373 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ – uhh, must have forgotten-
L411372 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
L411285 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Exactly.
L411284 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
L411283 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Yes, it's lame.
L411282 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It is?
L411281 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
L411280 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
L411270 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
L411269 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L411268 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
L411267 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
L411266 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What's that?
L411249 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
L411248 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
L411247 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
L411246 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What is with this school and prom?
L411213 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
L411212 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ College?
L411211 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
L411210 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Petty good.
L411209 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
L411208 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Sure. No problem.
L411207 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks.
L411206 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
L411194 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
L411193 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
L411191 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
L411190 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
L411189 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh I know.
L411188 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
L411187 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah. Let's do that.
L411186 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ : Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
L411185 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Why do they listen to Guy?
L411184 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
L411183 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ How long will they watch us for?
L411182 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Nice.
L411181 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
L411180 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Well, do you?
L411179 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What?
L411176 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
L411175 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
L411174 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
L411173 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
L411172 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
L411171 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
L411370 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Nope.
L411369 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ No Roger from op/ed?
L411368 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
L411367 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
L411366 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
L411365 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
L411364 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
L411363 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Leave.
L411362 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Gus, have you ever been in love?
L411040 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ YOU KNIT?
L411039 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ YOU DID.
L410934 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
L410933 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Oh, man! Who told?
L411549 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
L411548 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Well excuse me.
L411547 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
L411546 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
L411525 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Right. Right.
L411524 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
L411523 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
L411518 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ If you say so.
L411517 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're Pam?
L411516 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
L411515 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
L411820 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
L411819 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wow. It's packed.
L411783 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
L411782 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ You need my help?
L411781 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
L411780 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
L411522 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ 
L411521 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Hi!
L411084 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
L411083 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Anita!
L411082 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
L411081 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ 'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
L411080 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Cuuuute!
L411079 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
L411078 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ How about this?
L411077 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Very romantic.
L411076 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Bridgework?
L411075 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What'd you feel when you kissed him?
L411074 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
L411073 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That is lingerie.
L411072 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Now this is cute.
L411071 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
L411070 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
L411069 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Okay. That's bad.
L411068 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
L411067 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
L411066 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Anita, remember espadrilles?
L411065 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ So, you were a geek. Big deal.
L411038 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
L411037 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Senorita Josie.
L411036 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
L411035 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Jos, that's not what we're --
L411034 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
L411030 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
L411029 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You don't think I can do it.
L411028 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
L411027 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
L410975 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
L410974 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
L410973 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
L410972 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
L410971 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
L410970 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
L410969 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Anita!
L410968 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
L410967 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'm concentrating on my career right now.
L410966 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
L410965 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Forget it.
L410957 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ You stood for like a month.
L410956 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L410955 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
L410936 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
L410935 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
L410927 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
L410926 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
L410925 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Who told!
L410924 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Roger in Op/Ed.
L410923 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Guess who I did it with last night...
L411338 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
L411337 +++$+++ u6856 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
L411336 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wings?
L411335 +++$+++ u6856 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hidden camera.
L411334 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What is this?
L411333 +++$+++ u6856 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just get in the van, Josie.
L411332 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ George! What are you doing here?
L411705 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
L411704 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
L411672 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
L411671 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
L411566 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
L411565 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
L411531 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Sometimes opposites attract.
L411530 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
L411507 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
L411506 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
L411679 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
L411678 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
L411624 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Betty.
L411623 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
L411581 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ By Guy?
L411580 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Do I want to be crunched?
L411579 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ He is totally crunching on you.
L411568 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Why?
L411567 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ : Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
L411562 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ You crossed over.
L411561 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Transitioned?
L411560 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Josie, you have totally transitioned.
L411513 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
L411512 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ I think it's pronounced gauche.
L411152 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
L411151 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
L411778 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
L411777 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
L411776 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
L411660 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
L411659 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
L411658 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
L411657 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
L411656 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ He's my teacher!
L411655 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
L411654 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
L411653 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ That's your story!
L411343 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
L411342 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What if I say no?
L411341 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
L411340 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Gus?
L411303 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ OUT!
L411302 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
L411301 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
L411300 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ They hid my car--
L411299 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Do you even know these kids?
L411298 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
L411297 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
L411296 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
L411295 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Have you been to any parties?
L411294 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Uhh, no.
L411293 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Have you been there?
L411292 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
L411291 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Kristen got a quote?
L411290 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
L411289 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh. Right.
L411288 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
L411203 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
L411202 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
L411201 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
L411200 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It's an expose on cafeteria food.
L411199 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You're a sick puppy, Geller.
L411198 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
L411033 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Geller, this is way out of your league.
L411032 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ But I don't want it straightened out.
L411031 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
L410952 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey--I can be out of control.
L410951 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
L410950 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
L410949 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
L410948 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ A--flack jacket.
L410947 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ A flack jacket.
L410946 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
L410945 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
L410944 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You've done five of my ideas.
L410943 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
L410942 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
L410941 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
L410940 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
L410939 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Eh.
L410938 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Five-- Six--
L410937 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ How many times have I fired her?
L410932 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
L410931 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, excuse me for caring about words.
L410930 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
L410929 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
L411723 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You said that already.
L411722 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
L411721 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh.
L411720 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ My sword.
L411719 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
L411718 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Hey--what are you thinking about?
L411689 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
L411688 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ You having fun?
L411617 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Cool. I'll catch you later.
L411616 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
L411615 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
L411614 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yes. I'll go. Yes.
L411613 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
L411610 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
L411609 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Maybe we should go in a different room?
L411603 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey. There.
L411602 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Hey there.
L411577 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Yeah, you gonna be there?
L411576 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob's?
L411430 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Dude, you rock!
L411429 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh my god.
L411157 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Are you in special ed?
L411156 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
L411598 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I'm Rob's prom date.
L411597 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey Rob, what's going on?
L411540 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ But I'm not a penguin.
L411539 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
L411538 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
L411537 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
L411536 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
L411535 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ God, I can't do this.
L411775 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
L411774 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I-
L411773 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
L411772 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ wasn't even thinking about-
L411771 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
L411770 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Really?
L411769 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
L411668 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I know.
L411667 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
L411666 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
L411665 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks. And what are -
L411664 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
L411663 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rufus?
L411662 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Wow, Josie- you look really-
L411601 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
L411600 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ And a gymnast!
L411599 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
L411427 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
L411426 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
L411425 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You're twenty-three years old!
L411424 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
L411423 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
L411419 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No. Josie, this is real.
L411418 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
L411331 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ That's the spirit!
L411330 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Better than I...
L411329 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
L411328 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yes, desperately.
L411327 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
L411326 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Little known fact.
L411325 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Is that true?
L411324 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
L411323 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
L411322 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
L411321 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob. Please focus.
L411320 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
L411319 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
L411318 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Why is that impossible?
L411317 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
L411316 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
L411315 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I can't do this.
L411314 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, I mean, no big whoop.
L411311 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Good.
L411310 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
L411309 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Are mom and dad here?
L411062 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
L411061 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
L411060 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Josie Grossie.
L411057 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Don't you remember what they called you?
L411056 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It was a long time ago -
L411055 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Do you remember high school?
L411054 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What!?
L411053 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
L411052 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Wow. This must be big.
L411050 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
L411049 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
L411048 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It's just for a couple of months.
L411003 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
L411002 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
L411001 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
L411000 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
L410999 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
L410998 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
L410997 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
L410996 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ See!
L410995 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Better person than I.
L410994 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
L410993 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
L410991 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
L410990 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ She just needs a new windshield wiper.
L410989 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
L410988 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No it's not. Guys name their penises.
L410987 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That is so--weird that you name your car.
L411836 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I finally found my story.
L411835 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
L411768 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I just can't look at you the same way.
L411767 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Please. Please don't walk away.
L411766 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
L411765 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
L411764 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
L411763 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
L411762 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ But now you don't have to--
L411761 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
L411760 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wait, I was going to tell you--
L411759 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
L411758 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You were attracted to me?
L411757 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
L411756 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
L411755 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ "Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
L411737 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah, I have.
L411736 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
L411734 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
L411733 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, I'm alone.
L411732 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, are you here with anybody?
L411731 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
L411725 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks. So do you.
L411724 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
L411652 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
L411651 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wow. You believe in me that much--
L411650 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
L411649 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh--yikes!
L411648 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
L411647 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
L411646 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
L411645 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, actually I do.
L411644 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Do you think you'll find her?
L411643 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Our penguin, right?
L411642 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ To put us back together again when we fall.
L411641 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
L411640 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
L411639 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
L411638 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
L411637 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
L411636 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
L411635 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
L411489 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm thinking when I'm home.
L411488 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ When are you going to open your eyes?
L411487 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
L411486 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
L411485 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You have to say that. You're my teacher.
L411482 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
L411481 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
L411480 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Why do you do that?
L411479 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
L411478 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I know.
L411477 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Boys.
L411475 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I don't have to say that.
L411474 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You have to say that. You're my student.
L411473 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
L411472 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
L411471 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
L411470 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
L411467 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Don't look down!
L411466 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yoooooow.
L411465 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Of course. I remember everything from your class.
L411464 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You remember that story?
L411463 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
L411462 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
L411461 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
L411460 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
L411459 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Are you--scared?
L411457 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L411456 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This seat taken?
L411358 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
L411357 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
L411356 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
L411355 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
L411354 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
L411353 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ College. Haven't really thought about it.
L411352 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So what are you thinking for college?
L411351 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L411350 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
L411349 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh I don't think so.
L411348 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
L411262 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
L411261 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
L411260 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Sure, why?
L411259 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
L411258 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
L411257 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
L411256 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I love the way she writes.
L411255 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You like her?
L411254 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Dorothy Parker--
L411253 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Sorry. Forgetful.
L411252 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Whoa. Deja Vu.
L411119 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
L411118 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
L411239 +++$+++ u6866 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.
L411238 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
L411237 +++$+++ u6866 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I don't know.
L411236 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Why?
L411235 +++$+++ u6866 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
L411234 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What?
L411233 +++$+++ u6866 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Yes.
L411746 +++$+++ u6861 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
L411745 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ You ruined the whole thing!
L411677 +++$+++ u6861 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ Who are you guys?
L411676 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Josie, you look Rufus.
L411570 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ We're very evolved.
L411569 +++$+++ u6861 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
L411564 +++$+++ u6861 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
L411563 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Into our group.
L411146 +++$+++ u6861 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ Nah uh.
L411145 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
L411098 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
L411097 +++$+++ u6861 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ That is so sad --
L410985 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
L410984 +++$+++ u6863 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ MONTY +++$+++ Aloha! Welcome!
L410983 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
L410982 +++$+++ u6863 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ MONTY +++$+++ Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
L410981 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
L410980 +++$+++ u6863 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ MONTY +++$+++ I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
L410979 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
L411702 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
L411701 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Wow - I-
L411698 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Maybe we should sit.
L411697 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
L411696 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah. Definitely.
L411695 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Are you having fun?
L411608 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
L411607 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well, a ball player.
L411606 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
L411433 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Duh.
L411432 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Thank you.  I'm Rob.
L411431 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
