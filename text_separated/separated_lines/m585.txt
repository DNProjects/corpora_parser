L627099 +++$+++ u8619 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
L627098 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Can you cover me for an hour?
L627095 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Simon?  Ohmygod.
L627094 +++$+++ u8619 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Helen!  It's your mystery man.
L626923 +++$+++ u8619 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
L626922 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
L626921 +++$+++ u8619 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
L626920 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You bitch.
L626915 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yeah.  You know Harry.
L626914 +++$+++ u8619 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I'm shocked.
L626913 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
L626912 +++$+++ u8619 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
L626911 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
L627404 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I have a book report.
L627403 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where are you off to young lady?
L627402 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I'm done.
L627227 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Out.
L627226 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L627225 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
L627028 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
L627027 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That's not true, honey--
L627026 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
L627025 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
L627024 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
L627023 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L627639 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
L627638 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
L627401 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
L627400 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
L627399 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Dad, how come you know the words?
L627392 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
L627391 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
L627390 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L627389 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
L627125 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Fine.
L627124 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How was school today?
L626947 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
L626946 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
L626945 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Okay, Dad.
L626944 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
L626943 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Yeah, Dad.
L626942 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Dana, are you listening to me?
L626941 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
L626940 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
L626939 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You seem fine now.
L626938 +++$+++ u8620 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
L626937 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
L627247 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ Roger, One.  Rolling.
L627246 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
L626965 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
L626964 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
L626933 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
L626932 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're kidding.
L626931 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
L626930 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
L626929 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
L627084 +++$+++ u8629 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ TRILBY +++$+++ This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
L627083 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ Probably because it sounds scary.				*
L627082 +++$+++ u8629 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ TRILBY +++$+++ Why?
L627081 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
L626901 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
L626900 +++$+++ u8629 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ TRILBY +++$+++ So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
L626899 +++$+++ u8621 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ FAISIL +++$+++ Yes.
L626898 +++$+++ u8629 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ TRILBY +++$+++ Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
L627618 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sorry.
L627617 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ He's got it.
L627613 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
L627612 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
L627597 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
L627596 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Any minute now.
L627586 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Here they come.
L627585 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ ... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
L627582 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
L627581 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
L627580 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ ... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
L627579 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ --you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
L627578 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ You're welcome.
L627577 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
L627576 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ I thought this look like your work.
L627417 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
L627416 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
L627386 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
L627385 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
L627353 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
L627352 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
L627351 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
L627350 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Now what?
L627344 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
L627343 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ She could be telling the truth.
L627336 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You didn't have sexual relations with him?
L627335 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ She's lying.
L627256 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ You know about that?
L627255 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
L627254 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
L627253 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You tell on me, I tell on you.
L627252 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
L627242 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ The purse is still at the house.
L627241 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's still at my house.						*
L627234 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
L627233 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
L627232 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
L627231 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L627230 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Give me the page.
L627160 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ He could be working her to get to you.
L627159 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, but for who?							*
L627158 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Guy's a spook!
L627123 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
L627122 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
L627120 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
L627119 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ What're you talking about?  We have that.
L627118 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Put a tap on her phone.
L627117 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Is this national security stuff boring you?
L627111 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
L627110 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I still don't believe it.
L627109 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
L627108 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It can't be.
L627107 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Nobody believes it can happen to them.
L627106 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It can't be.  Not Helen.
L627105 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
L627104 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's having an affair.
L627103 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
L627102 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
L627091 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ I'll just hang then, shall I?
L627090 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Just hang a minute.
L627089 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ You want me to just hang-- ?
L627088 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
L627078 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
L627077 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Abu Kaleem Malik.
L627075 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
L627074 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Son of a bitch!
L627073 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
L627072 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
L627071 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
L627068 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
L627067 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
L627066 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Okay.  Here she comes.
L627065 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
L627041 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
L627040 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Copy that.
L627020 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Stay on him.
L627019 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ There's another guy, still in the car.
L627018 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
L627017 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ What's the plan?
L627014 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
L627013 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Helen's going to be pissed.
L627008 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
L627007 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Station wagon?
L626985 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L626984 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
L626963 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
L626962 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
L626950 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
L626949 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
L626928 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
L626927 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
L626892 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ In her dreams.
L626891 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
L626883 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
L626882 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
L626880 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
L626879 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I thought you moved out.
L626878 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
L626876 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Will you just open the door!					*
L626875 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
L626874 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No way.  Not Dana.
L626873 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
L626872 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Right.  She's only fourteen.
L626871 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Fourteen, Harry.
L626870 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
L626869 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
L626866 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
L626865 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
L626864 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
L626861 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ What?
L626860 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Son of a bitch!
L626858 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Here, check these out.
L626857 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Thanks dear.
L626834 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Yep.  Sleep fast.
L626833 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What a team.  See you at eight.
L626831 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
L626830 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
L626829 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What's this for?
L626824 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L626823 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Harry?  HARRY?!
L626821 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ In the helicopter.
L626820 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Harry!  Where are you!
L626790 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
L626789 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
L627338 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ You're not going anywhere.
L627337 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
L627323 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
L627322 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ My husband is a good man.
L627314 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I wasn't cheating!
L627313 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ So, it was your first time.
L627312 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No!  Never!
L627311 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
L627297 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
L627296 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ But you didn't.  Why not?
L627295 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
L626890 +++$+++ u8625 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L626889 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
L626888 +++$+++ u8625 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ Yes sir.
L626887 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ And you still reach for your piece every time.
L626886 +++$+++ u8625 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ Ten, Mr. Gibson.
L626885 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
L627512 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Sure.  Say that now.
L627511 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
L627510 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Did you tell her about us, Harry?
L627509 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're damaged goods, lady.
L627508 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
L627499 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Not exactly.
L627498 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oral hygiene?
L627497 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
L627450 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
L627449 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hello, Harry.
L627003 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uh, yes, it is important.
L627002 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yes what?
L627001 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes.
L626993 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
L626992 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
L626991 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Is that why you got into this business?
L626990 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
L626989 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's certainly... dramatic.
L626988 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
L626959 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
L626958 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
L626956 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
L626955 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
L626954 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I agree.
L626953 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, what's the point of waiting?
L626813 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'd like that.
L626812 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
L626804 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I adore it.
L626803 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
L626802 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
L627644 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Dance?
L627643 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Not yet.  But we'll find him.
L627636 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
L627635 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ ... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
L627568 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
L627567 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh shit.
L627566 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
L627565 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L627562 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
L627561 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
L627554 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.  Much more.
L627553 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ As much as you used to?
L627552 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes.
L627551 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Do you still love me?
L627550 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L627549 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
L627547 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Harry... snap out of it!
L627546 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ God, you have great legs.
L627545 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What is it?
L627537 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Looks that way.
L627536 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
L627535 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.  But I wanted to.
L627534 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Did you pork her Harry?
L627533 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's really a fox, isn't she?
L627532 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What about Juno?
L627531 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't take those assignments.
L627530 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
L627529 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ 17 years.
L627525 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yup.										*
L627524 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Are we going to die?
L627523 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
L627522 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Is it working yet?
L627521 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes.
L627520 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It makes you tell the truth?
L627519 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
L627518 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What did he give you?
L627482 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
L627481 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm sorry, honey.
L627461 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
L627460 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
L627459 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
L627447 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You wouldn't believe me.
L627446 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What were you doing there?
L627442 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
L627441 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
L627440 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
L627431 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'm not wearing any.
L627430 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Now slide the nylons off one by one.
L627415 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sure, hon.
L627414 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
L627406 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
L627405 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
L627365 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.  Doris.
L627364 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Natasha?
L627363 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
L627362 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I can do it!
L627361 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
L627360 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I think so.
L627359 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
L627358 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ My husband can't know about this.
L627357 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You will be contacted with the assignment.
L627356 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
L627355 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes or no.
L627354 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
L627349 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
L627348 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Louder please.
L627347 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.
L627346 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Do you still love your husband?
L627345 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What?
L627340 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Answer the question--
L627339 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Let me out of her!  Right now!
L627334 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No.
L627333 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
L627331 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
L627330 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What did you need?
L627329 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
L627328 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why?
L627327 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.
L627326 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And you agreed?
L627325 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
L627324 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
L627321 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
L627320 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
L627318 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yeah.  I suppose he is.
L627317 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Would you say he was boring, then?
L627316 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
L627315 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
L627310 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Well, maybe a little.
L627309 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You weren't attracted to him at all?
L627308 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No.
L627307 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Not because you were attracted to him?
L627306 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He needed my help.
L627305 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why did you continue to see him?
L627299 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
L627298 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What did happen?
L627290 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
L627289 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How long have you been a member of his faction?
L627141 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
L627140 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
L627132 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
L627131 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
L627130 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
L627129 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ They said you had to run out.
L627128 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They must've just missed me.
L627127 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
L627061 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ My husband the hero.
L627060 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uh huh.
L627059 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
L627058 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ ...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
L627057 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
L627056 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What'd you do, honey?
L627055 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
L627054 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
L627053 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
L627052 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
L627049 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yeah.  It was great.
L627048 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
L627047 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
L627046 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
L626982 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
L626981 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
L626980 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
L626936 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'll handle it.
L626935 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
L626854 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Good thinking, honey.
L626853 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
L626852 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What did you tell him?
L626851 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's not okay.  It's extortion.
L626850 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uh huh.  Okay.
L626847 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, it was wild.
L626846 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That's fabulous Harry.
L626845 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
L626844 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
L626843 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Me too.
L626842 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm late.
L626837 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Okay.
L626836 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
L626835 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
L627375 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
L627374 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Beat it.
L627368 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
L627367 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
L627366 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Yeeaoowww!!
L627223 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
L627222 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
L627221 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
L627220 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
L627219 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
L627218 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
L627216 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
L627215 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What does she do?
L627214 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
L627213 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You working on someone right now?
L627212 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Those idiots.
L627211 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
L627210 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What about the husbands?
L627209 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
L627208 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Use 'em and lose 'em.
L627207 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
L627206 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
L627205 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
L627204 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
L627203 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
L627202 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
L627201 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Sorry.  Trade secret.
L627200 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So what's your angle?
L627199 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
L627198 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And you've got one.
L627197 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
L627194 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Absolutely.
L627193 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
L627641 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Go ahead.
L627640 +++$+++ u8630 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Boris and Doris?
L627413 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
L627412 +++$+++ u8630 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Get going! 
L627411 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What?
L627288 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He said he was an American agent.
L627287 +++$+++ u8630 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
L627286 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
L627285 +++$+++ u8630 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
L627584 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Fuck you.
L627583 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Like one?
L627516 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hold that thought.
L627515 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
L627514 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
L627501 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
L627500 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's going on, Harry?
L627457 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
L627456 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
L627455 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
L627454 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
L627453 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
L627452 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Who's your little friend?
L627303 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I just glances inside.
L627302 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
L627301 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Helen.
L627300 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
L627280 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
L627279 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
L627278 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
L627274 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
L627273 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I have to think...
L627272 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
L627271 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ We're going to Paris?
L627270 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
L627269 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'm married!
L627268 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Helen, I want you to be my wife.
L627267 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What is it you need me to do?
L627266 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ To our assignment.
L627239 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
L627238 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's happened?
L627185 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Yes.  Now go.
L627184 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You'll call me then?
L627183 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
L627182 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What is it you want me to do?
L627177 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
L627176 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ And you chased one?
L627175 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
L627174 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Were they trying to kill you?					*
L627172 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
L627171 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
L627170 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
L627169 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You can trust me completely.
L627168 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'm sorry, I can't.
L627167 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Tell me what happened?
L627165 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
L627164 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That was you?!
L627163 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
L627162 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.
L627161 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Did you read the papers yesterday?
L627157 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
L627156 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Worse than Cairo?							*
L627155 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
L627154 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
L627153 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
L627152 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I understand.
L627151 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
L627150 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
L627149 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Are you sure you weren't followed?
L627139 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
L627138 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
L627136 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.  Go ahead.
L627135 +++$+++ u8628 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
L627134 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Hello?
L627467 +++$+++ u8627 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ MALIK +++$+++ His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
L627466 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ His wife.
L627465 +++$+++ u8627 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ MALIK +++$+++ Who is this woman?
L626975 +++$+++ u8627 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ MALIK +++$+++ Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
L626974 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ How?
L626973 +++$+++ u8627 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ MALIK +++$+++ Find out who this Renquist it.
L626972 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L626970 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No.  He checked out okay--
L626969 +++$+++ u8627 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ MALIK +++$+++ Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
L626968 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ It's a good thing you pay me well.
