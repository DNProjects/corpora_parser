L34149 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'll do it.
L34044 +++$+++ u3636 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ CHOIR TEACHER +++$+++ Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
L34043 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
L34042 +++$+++ u3636 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ CHOIR TEACHER +++$+++ No, it was good.
L34041 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Sorry.
L34040 +++$+++ u3636 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ CHOIR TEACHER +++$+++ What the hell was that?
L34402 +++$+++ u3637 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COACH MARSHALL +++$+++ What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
L34401 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Sorry, coach.
L34400 +++$+++ u3637 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COACH MARSHALL +++$+++ Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
L34081 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ -- Thanks, coach --
L34080 +++$+++ u3637 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COACH MARSHALL +++$+++ You're a killer, Ozzy!
L34079 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Thanks coach.
L34078 +++$+++ u3637 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COACH MARSHALL +++$+++ Good work, Ostreicher.
L33845 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'm not good in math.
L33844 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
L33843 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ ...okay...
L33842 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
L33841 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Like what?
L33840 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
L33838 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ You need some work, buddy!
L33837 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
L33835 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Suck me...beautiful?
L33834 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ What did you just say?
L33832 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
L33831 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ Sure.
L33830 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Great evening, isn't it?
L34009 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
L34008 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
L34003 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
L34002 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
L33907 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
L33906 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
L33905 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Good morning gentleman.
L33766 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
L33765 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
L33764 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
L34538 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Neither did I!
L34537 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ I had no idea you'd be this good!
L34536 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Yes ma'am, I am.
L34535 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
L34534 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
L34497 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
L34496 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Single malt?
L34495 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ All right, I got some scotch.
L34494 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
L34493 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ I believe the kegs are upstairs.
L34492 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ ...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
L34491 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ Pardon me?
L34490 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
L34489 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
L34488 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
L34487 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
L34486 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
L34566 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
L34565 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
L34456 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
L34455 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Me too.  For the most part.
L34382 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
L34381 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
L34380 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Charming.
L34379 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You're gonna shit your pants!
L34378 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Why is this?
L34377 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Just go!
L34376 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
L34375 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
L34219 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No idea.
L34218 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ What do you suppose they're saying?
L34192 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Seduce her.
L34191 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
L34007 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
L34006 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What are we gonna hear?
L34005 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
L34004 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Of course, Finch.  What?
L34001 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L34000 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ This.  Right now.
L33999 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Yep.
L33998 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ This is your plan, Finch?
L34522 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Then don't.
L34521 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
L34485 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I know, it sucks!
L34484 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
L34482 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
L34481 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You called me Oz.
L34480 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oz, it's okay, I know.
L34479 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
L34478 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ This isn't any better, Chris.
L34477 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
L34476 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ This isn't the best way to proposition me.
L34475 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
L34474 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ What's that?
L34473 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
L34409 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ No.  I'm missing the game for you.
L34408 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ You're missing the game for us?!
L34407 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'm not playing.
L34406 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ What about the game?!
L34371 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
L34370 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
L34369 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
L34368 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ You can't sing at the competition.
L34367 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
L34340 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ ...yeah.
L34339 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
L34338 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ So we're gonna be close next year?
L34337 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Sure.
L34336 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I know.  Salt and pepper?
L34335 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
L34334 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
L34333 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
L34332 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
L34331 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
L34330 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
L34329 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
L34328 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You want onions?
L34327 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ What?
L34326 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Onions?
L34325 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
L34324 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ So you're going to Michigan?
L34323 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ That's nice.
L34322 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
L34321 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
L34320 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
L34319 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Uh...my dad's the manager.
L34317 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ ...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
L34316 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
L34315 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You talked to Stifler?
L34314 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Stifler told me.
L34313 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ How did you know I was here?
L34312 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Hi...
L34154 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
L34153 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Because I want to.
L34152 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L34144 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Give me a break, you're so full of it.
L34143 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I wasn't making fun of you.
L34142 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
L34141 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ What?  No I'm not.
L34140 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
L34139 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ What?!
L34138 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
L34137 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You don't like it?
L34136 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ I'm glad you think so.
L34135 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Nice car.
L34101 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
L34100 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
L34093 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
L34092 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Neither will I.
L34091 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Come on!  I won't tell.
L34090 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Forget it.
L34089 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ What's your middle name?
L34088 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You can call me Ostreicher.
L34087 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Do I have to?
L34086 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You can call me Oz.
L34085 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Um...Chris --
L34083 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
L34082 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Hey, what're you doing here?
L34057 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
L34056 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
L34055 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
L34054 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
L34053 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
L34052 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
L34051 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Of course, I didn't --
L34050 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
L34049 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
L34048 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
L34047 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
L34046 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
L34045 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Not bad, Chris.
L33899 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Sure.
L33898 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Jessica, can you drive me home?
L33885 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
L33884 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ ...I've never tried it.
L33883 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
L33882 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ I think I've had one.
L33881 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
L33880 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ He likes it.
L33724 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Please.
L33723 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
L33722 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
L33721 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
L33720 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ That's not why we're going out.
L33719 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
L33718 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ What?  We both have cars.
L33717 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Yeah right.
L33716 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
L34358 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
L34357 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I don't get it, that really works?
L34356 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
L34355 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Then what the hell are you talking about?
L34354 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Are you kidding?  No.
L34353 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Did you guys hook up or something?
L34352 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Thanks.  It was my idea.
L34351 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
L34350 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No comment.
L33982 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
L33981 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
L33980 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
L33979 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
L33978 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Do you love her?
L33977 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Of course.
L33976 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Do you?
L33975 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
L33974 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No.
L33973 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ But that one time --
L33972 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No you haven't.
L33971 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
L33970 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You got it, stud.
L33969 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You mean...and orgasm?
L33968 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
L33967 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What?
L33966 +++$+++ u3641 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
L33677 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Uh...
L33676 +++$+++ u3649 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK +++$+++ Fuck me!  Yes!
L33667 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
L33666 +++$+++ u3649 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK +++$+++ You're so big!
L33665 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I do, baby, I do.
L33664 +++$+++ u3649 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK +++$+++ Don't you love my sexy body?!
L33663 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
L33662 +++$+++ u3649 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK +++$+++ Give it to me!  Yes!
L33660 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
L33659 +++$+++ u3649 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK +++$+++ Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
L34564 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L34563 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
L34451 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I'm not going.
L34450 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
L34434 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
L34433 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
L34430 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
L34429 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
L34428 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
L34412 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You fuckin' rule!
L34411 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
L34277 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
L34276 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
L34275 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She's already on a plane back home.
L34274 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ How do you know that?
L34271 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
L34270 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Hey, minuteman.
L34259 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Holy shit!
L34258 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Holy shit.
L34205 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ He's going in!
L34204 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Please, God.  Let this be it.
L34200 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
L34199 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
L34197 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh...oh...oh, shit!
L34196 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
L34195 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's stupid.
L34194 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
L34193 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But, but -- what would I do?
L34183 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Just in time.
L34182 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Did I miss anything?!
L34162 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I'll save you a seat.
L34161 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
L34160 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You can send me the address too.
L34114 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
L34113 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Went home to shit.
L34112 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hey, where's Finch?
L34018 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, enormous.
L34017 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
L34016 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
L33941 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Exactly three weeks to the day.
L33940 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Right.  That gives us...
L33939 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
L33929 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
L33928 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
L33927 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Pontificated.
L33926 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
L33923 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
L33922 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Like a bet?
L33904 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sorry, I thought you were dead.
L33903 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Ow, what the hell?
L33809 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But --
L33808 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Gotta go.
L33784 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
L33783 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
L33779 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
L33778 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
L33769 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It's all good.  Breath check.
L33768 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You can crash at Stifler's?
L33767 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
L33763 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
L33762 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
L33726 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Finch, you got the Latin homework?
L33725 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's our man.
L33710 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
L33709 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You think she was serious?
L33708 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Nothing, I just hugged her back.
L33707 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And you said...
L34172 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
L34171 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dad!!
L34170 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
L34169 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dad.
L34166 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know.  Hey Nadia.
L34165 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Son.  This lady's here for you.
L34077 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
L34076 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes.
L34075 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
L34074 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
L34038 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's not what it looks like!
L34037 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Jim?
L33961 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Okay, well that about covers it.
L33960 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Thank you, dad, I got it.
L33959 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
L33958 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes dad.
L33957 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Do you know about the clitoris?
L33956 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dad!  I know!
L33955 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
L33954 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know, Dad.
L33951 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ These are for you.  From father to son.
L33950 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay.
L33948 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dad, come in.
L33947 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ You're not...busy?
L33946 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
L33945 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ Can I come in?
L33681 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nothing!
L33680 +++$+++ u3643 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM'S DAD +++$+++ What the heck is this?
L34542 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Okay!
L34541 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
L34540 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Don't you want me to?
L34539 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
L34533 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
L34532 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
L34531 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
L34530 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This'll do.
L34529 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
L34528 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ...excuse me?!
L34527 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
L34526 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay, I get it.
L34525 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
L34524 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
L34502 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
L34501 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, bring it on!
L34500 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
L34499 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I told you.
L34498 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
L34467 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
L34466 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
L34465 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
L34464 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
L34463 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
L34424 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Highly, highly overrated.
L34423 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
L34290 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
L34289 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Whatever you want.
L34288 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
L34287 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes.  Seriously.
L34286 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
L34285 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
L34284 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Michelle.
L34283 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What was your name again?
L34282 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
L34281 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, that's pretty much it.
L34280 +++$+++ u3646 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
L34279 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
L34575 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ After high school.
L34574 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ After getting laid?
L34573 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
L34569 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I know.
L34568 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
L34567 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'll just say that we had a great night together.
L34462 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
L34461 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
L34454 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So do I, Kev.
L34453 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I still think you're okay.
L34273 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
L34272 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
L34158 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
L34157 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You can do that?
L33987 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
L33986 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
L33850 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
L33849 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
L33791 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
L33790 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
L33788 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
L33787 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
L33781 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
L33780 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Who cares?
L33777 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
L33776 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This was remade?  Into what?
L33761 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ "Fun loving" -- insane.
L33760 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
L33714 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No -- Kevin, you?
L33713 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You guys got the Latin homework?
L33704 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ C-Span?
L33703 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
L33702 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
L33701 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
L33700 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
L33699 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ She's a mermaid, dude.
L33698 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
L33697 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
L33914 +++$+++ u3650 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
L33913 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You did it.
L33797 +++$+++ u3650 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
L33796 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You've got something going?
L33795 +++$+++ u3650 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
L33794 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
L33793 +++$+++ u3650 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ What's up, fellas?
L34266 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
L34265 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
L34264 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, not again.
L34252 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
L34251 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
L34250 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
L34248 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
L34247 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
L34242 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh no.
L34241 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Jim...
L34226 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
L34225 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nadia, I can't --
L34224 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
L34223 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Um...okay...
L34222 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Move with the music.
L34221 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Uh...
L34217 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ For me?
L34216 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
L34215 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes, slowly.
L34214 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Strip?
L34213 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
L34212 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Uh...yeah...sorry.
L34211 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Shame on you!
L34210 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well...uh...
L34209 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
L34176 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
L34175 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So you need to change, right?
L34134 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I suppose that would be okay.
L34133 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
L34132 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
L34131 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
L34130 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes.  No.  Yes.
L34129 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Me?
L34128 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You are very good in the world history class, yes?
L33814 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Okay.
L33813 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No...you...go...ahead.
L33812 +++$+++ u3647 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I thought so.
L33811 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes.
L34374 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
L34373 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
L34372 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
L34240 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ This just got a hell of a lot better.
L34239 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Ho-lee shit.
L33857 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
L33856 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ God dammit, Stifler!
L33855 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
L33744 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
L33743 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Stifler, you're such an asshole.
L34560 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
L34559 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What?
L34558 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
L34557 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
L34555 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
L34554 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
L34553 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
L34552 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It did.
L34551 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Yeah, the time went by so fast.
L34550 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
L34549 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L34548 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That was a great night.
L34520 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ I love you.
L34519 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Victoria...I love you.
L34518 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Okay.
L34517 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ I want to hear you say it.
L34516 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah Vick?
L34515 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Okay.
L34514 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
L34513 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ I don't know.  How do you?
L34512 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
L34511 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah, right here.
L34510 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
L34509 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Me too.
L34508 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L34507 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah.  Are you sure?
L34506 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ You sure you're comfortable?
L34505 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L34504 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Yeah, are you?
L34503 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You comfortable?
L34469 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
L34468 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ See -- this is the nicest room.
L34422 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ No...I know the perfect time...
L34421 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Now?!
L34420 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
L34419 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
L34418 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
L34417 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
L34416 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ About the other day...I've been thinking.
L34415 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
L34414 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
L34413 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Hey...
L34311 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Okay.
L34310 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
L34309 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
L34308 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
L34307 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ But you don't love me.
L34306 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
L34305 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Kevin?  Do you not love me?
L34303 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Yes --
L34302 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You want to do it?
L34301 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ I think you're so right, Kevin.
L34300 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
L34299 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Like how?
L34298 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
L34297 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
L34296 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We've come a long way since Homecoming.
L34295 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
L34294 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That's my trick!
L34293 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
L34292 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You're not doing the extra credit problems.
L34066 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Just a second!
L34065 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
L34064 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
L34063 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Oh...ungghhhhh!
L34062 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ How?
L34061 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ And I want to try to make it up to you.
L34060 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
L34059 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ I think "shithead" really says it.
L34058 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
L33901 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Not for you.
L33900 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Vicky, wait.
L33853 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Okay, don't stop.
L33852 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Let me know.
L33825 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
L33824 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Tonight?
L33823 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
L33822 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Oh, Kev.
L33695 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You got in.
L33694 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ Kevin, this is serious!
L33693 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ "Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
L33692 +++$+++ u3654 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ VICKY +++$+++ You think so?
L33691 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
L34581 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ What's that?
L34580 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Hey.  I got another question for you.
L34034 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ You've just inherited The Bible.
L34033 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Qualify for what?
L34032 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
L34031 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
L34030 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
L34029 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What?!  How do I do that?
L34028 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
L34024 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
L34023 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ Say that again, Kevin?
L33757 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
L33756 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Ready for what?
L33755 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
L33754 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Does it tell me how to get laid?
L33753 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
L33752 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
L33751 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ Have you ever heard of the bible?
L33750 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
L33749 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ Just dial 976-Asshole.
L33748 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
L33747 +++$+++ u3645 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN'S BROTHER +++$+++ You called me to ask me how to get laid?
L34577 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Fuck yeah we will.
L34576 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
L34571 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I think we're falling in love.
L34570 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
L34562 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
L34561 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I guess we'll call you two-ply.
L34459 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ He didn't?
L34458 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
L34449 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I don't care.
L34448 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ ...Guess what?
L34436 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ <u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
L34435 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Kevin, it was just a --
L34432 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
L34431 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
L34126 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
L34125 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Okay, explain.
L34116 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Observe.
L34115 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ What reputation?
L34109 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
L34108 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ So does your tongue cramp up?
L33938 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
L33937 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Dude, prom sucks.
L33936 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
L33931 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
L33930 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
L33925 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
L33924 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
L33919 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
L33918 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
L33910 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That's the spirit.
L33909 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'm such a loser.
L33908 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Feeling better, Oz?
L33786 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Then where does a blowjob figure in?
L33785 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Contact, dude.
L33775 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
L33774 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ How the hell do you know all these random songs?
L33773 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
L33771 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
L33770 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
L33759 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Once, in church, dude.
L33758 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You ever hear of something called The Bible?
L33706 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Oh shit dude, the L-word!
L33705 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Then she said -- she loves me.
L34366 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ No shit.
L34365 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Our last game is this Saturday.
L34364 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
L34363 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Come on, you know the words, sing along.
L34362 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
L34105 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
L34104 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
L34098 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
L34097 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
L34096 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ <u>Yeah</u>!
L33997 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
L33996 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
L33991 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
L33990 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing here?
L33989 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Keep it down, dude.
L33988 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ I think you need your balls reattached.
L33848 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.
L33847 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
L33740 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Dude, he does not.
L33739 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
L33738 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ She works part-time at my dad's store.
L33737 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Bullshit.  From where?
L33736 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
L33735 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
L33734 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
L33733 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ That junior chick?
L33732 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Depends if my date wants to stop by.
L33731 +++$+++ u3652 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER +++$+++ You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
