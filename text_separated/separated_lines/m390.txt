L289046 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We, who is we?
L289045 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
L288825 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
L288824 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What happened?
L288440 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm sorry, it's a private function.
L288439 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
L288438 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
L288437 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ Paul, Paul, a moment please.
L288725 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll be back.
L288724 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
L288477 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of course.
L288476 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
L288475 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Leave it to me.
L288474 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
L288473 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Excuse me?
L288472 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ That's what I came to talk to you about.
L288471 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
L288469 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ Cockroaches?
L288468 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
L288419 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
L288418 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ Paul!
L288729 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
L288728 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
L288718 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
L288717 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
L288716 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
L288715 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Give me it.
L288714 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
L288713 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ And four children?
L288712 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Ten.
L288701 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Six.
L288700 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ How many in your family?
L288699 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
L288697 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't have that much.
L288696 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Ten thousand francs for each one.
L288695 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Name a price.
L288694 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ How much?
L288693 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
L288692 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You want to pay me?
L288689 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ There is nothing to it.
L288688 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Please, I don't use guns.
L288686 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Let me explain.
L288685 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
L288671 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Where is your family?
L288670 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
L288669 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of course.
L288668 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
L288667 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I used to work at the Diplomat.
L288666 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No. I work at the Mille Collines.
L288665 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
L288664 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
L288663 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
L288662 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Let me see your identity card.
L288661 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What is this about?
L288660 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ We are looking for you.
L288659 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
L288658 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Who are you?
L288801 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
L288800 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ What was the response?
L288799 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Yes we have.
L288798 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Have you requested re-enforcements?
L288797 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
L288796 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
L288795 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
L288794 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
L288793 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
L288792 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
L289294 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
L289293 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
L289292 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
L289291 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
L289290 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
L289280 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
L289279 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What is it?
L289276 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ I can't, I don't have the men.
L289275 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Will you protect us.
L289274 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
L289273 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
L289272 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
L289271 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They fired a rocket at us.
L288886 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ They're only taking the whites.
L288885 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Their people?
L288884 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
L288883 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
L288882 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't understand.
L288881 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
L288880 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Excuse me, Colonel.
L288879 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
L288878 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
L288877 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Canadian Club?
L288876 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Anything. Strong.
L288830 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where is she?
L288829 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
L288828 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What's happening?
L288827 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
L288804 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
L288803 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
L288802 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
L288782 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
L288781 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
L288780 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Paul, you know who this is?
L289344 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I will do nothing unless you help me now.
L289343 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ You will tell them the truth.
L289342 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You think they will believe you?
L289341 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ I led no massacres.
L289340 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
L289339 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ I committed no war crimes.
L289338 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
L289337 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ You lie.
L289336 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
L289335 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ I am on a list! What list?
L289334 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
L289333 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ How so.
L289332 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You are a marked man.
L289331 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Listen, you need me.
L289330 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ We are better here.
L289328 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
L289327 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
L289326 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
L289325 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
L289324 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
L289323 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
L289322 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
L289321 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, sir.
L289320 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
L289319 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L289318 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ You know what the Scottish call it?
L289313 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Today.
L289312 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ When?
L289311 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
L289310 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What do you mean, General?
L289309 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
L289308 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where are they going?
L289307 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
L289306 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Your police are at the gate?
L289305 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Get in.
L289304 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We must go to the Diplomat.
L289303 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Bring back your policemen...
L289302 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ I'll be over.
L289301 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
L289300 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Whiskey?
L289299 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
L289250 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
L289249 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
L289248 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
L289247 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Where are my supplies?
L289225 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
L289224 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ You said you had no whiskey.
L289223 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
L289041 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
L289040 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
L289039 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
L289038 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ I will see what I can do.
L289037 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The front gate would be best, General.
L289036 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
L289035 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ “Well rewarded” Those were his words.
L289034 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ He did.
L289033 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
L289032 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ The police are very busy.
L289031 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
L289026 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
L289025 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
L289024 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ 'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
L289023 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ The high command? Our high command?
L289022 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
L289021 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ And what will they do with these satellites?
L289020 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
L289019 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Satellites?
L289018 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Satellites.
L289017 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ Watch everything? How? They are gone.
L289016 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
L289015 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ What did they say?
L289014 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
L289013 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ What did you overhear?
L289012 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
L289011 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
L289010 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The United Nations are still here.
L289009 +++$+++ u5901 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GENERAL BIZIMUNGU +++$+++ As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
L289008 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

L288968 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That will take time.
L288967 +++$+++ u5906 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.

L289093 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He will be here.
L289092 +++$+++ u5907 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MILITIAMAN #1 +++$+++ The commander is not here.
L289091 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
L289090 +++$+++ u5907 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MILITIAMAN #1 +++$+++ What do you want?
L289172 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I will give you my house.
L289171 +++$+++ u5908 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MR. GARINDI +++$+++ Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
L289170 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How do you know?
L289169 +++$+++ u5908 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MR. GARINDI +++$+++ No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
L289168 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
L289167 +++$+++ u5908 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MR. GARINDI +++$+++ It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
L288863 +++$+++ u5908 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MR. GARINDI +++$+++ No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
L288862 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Was there blood?
L288767 +++$+++ u5908 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MR. GARINDI +++$+++ I will see what I can do.
L288766 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
L288765 +++$+++ u5908 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MR. GARINDI +++$+++ No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
L288764 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
L288763 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I need a great favor.
L288762 +++$+++ u5908 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ MR. GARINDI +++$+++ Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
L289359 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
L289358 +++$+++ u5915 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
L289286 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
L289285 +++$+++ u5915 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ This time the Militia will kill us.
L289003 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Also, this is your bill for the last week.
L289002 +++$+++ u5915 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Pack the bags, we have to move.
L289001 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
L289000 +++$+++ u5915 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The third floor are low class rooms.
L288999 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm going to put you on the third floor.
L288998 +++$+++ u5915 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Move? Where to?
L288997 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm afraid you will have to move room.
L288784 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of course.
L288783 +++$+++ u5915 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I will need a suite.
L289371 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Anais, it is so good to see you.
L289370 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Oh, my babies.
L289298 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I have to go to the Diplomat.
L289297 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L289296 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
L289267 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
L289266 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Please do not talk like this.
L289265 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
L289264 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What sort of plan?
L289263 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We have to have a plan.
L289261 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We are almost out of everything.
L289260 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ We are almost out of water.
L289213 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Paul! Then another voice.
L289212 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I love you. Keep the children safe.
L289211 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I will follow on the next plane. Go.
L289210 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Let me go. Children get off.
L289208 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
L289207 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ No! Sit down now.
L289206 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I have to stay.
L289204 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ No.
L289203 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Get on the truck, Tatiana.
L289202 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
L289192 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
L289191 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ A little longer, Paul?
L289166 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
L289165 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Please, please try one more time.
L289164 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We have to get out of here Tatiana.
L289163 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I will not leave without the twins.
L289151 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ A Volkswagen!
L289150 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A Volkswagen.
L289149 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I want to know.
L289148 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What does it matter.
L289147 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What sort of car?
L289146 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A car.
L289145 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Tell me what it was.
L289144 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It was substantial.
L289143 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
L289142 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ To be closer. So that I could marry you.
L289141 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Why?
L289140 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
L289139 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What?
L289138 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I had you transferred to Kigali.
L289137 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Yes.
L289136 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
L289135 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ In Ruhengeri?
L289134 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I have a confession. When we met...
L289132 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A kiss.
L289131 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
L289130 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
L289129 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
L289078 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
L289077 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ You cannot go alone.
L289076 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
L289075 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ No, no.
L289074 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
L289073 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Go out! Where?
L289072 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I have to go out to get food.
L289070 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We're running out of beer and other supplies.
L289069 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What's the matter?
L289068 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
L289067 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ So where is the lamb?
L289066 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
L288936 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do as I say. I will be there soon.
L288935 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What for Paul.
L288934 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Go to the roof now.
L288922 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
L288921 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
L288920 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What are you saying, Tatsi?
L288919 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ You could leave, Paul.
L288897 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
L288896 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ But who is left?
L288895 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
L288893 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We have been abandoned.
L288892 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What about us?
L288891 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They are being evacuated.
L288870 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No. They are not dead. Stop this.
L288869 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
L288866 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Please go back, bring the children to us.
L288865 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
L288836 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Give him time.
L288835 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
L288834 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How can we help him.
L288833 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ No, Odette says he's in shock.
L288832 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Has Roger spoken yet?
L288761 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll try.
L288760 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
L288759 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Any luck?
L288758 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ It will do just fine.
L288757 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ This won't do.
L288746 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
L288745 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
L288744 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What!
L288743 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
L288742 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
L288706 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Get in.
L288705 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Paul, don't let them die.
L288655 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Stay with the children.
L288654 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What is it, Paul.
L288640 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where are you hurt, son?
L288639 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Oh, my God!
L288632 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dawn. Then they go.
L288631 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Please, Paul, 'til first light.
L288630 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They know you are Tutsi!
L288629 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
L288628 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
L288627 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
L288626 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
L288623 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I tried already. The phones do not work.
L288622 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I sent them home. Go and call them.
L288621 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Where are Thomas and Fedens?
L288618 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Murdered! By whom?
L288617 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ The president has been murdered.
L288614 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Jean Baptiste!
L288613 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
L288547 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
L288546 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ They do not have your connections.
L288545 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
L288544 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
L288543 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
L288542 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ You could have asked for a favor.
L288541 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I couldn't help.
L288540 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
L288536 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ We must do something.
L288535 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L288533 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Please, be quiet.
L288532 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
L288531 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What?
L288530 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Do something.
L288509 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Homework?
L288508 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
L288492 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Of course.
L288491 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Let's have dinner first.
L288490 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ He wants your wisdom.
L288489 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thomas wants advice?
L288483 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Yes, with Fedens and the children.
L288482 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Your brother's here?
L288481 +++$+++ u5914 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
L288480 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
L288983 +++$+++ u5913 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ SABENA PRESIDENT +++$+++ I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
L288982 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why?
L288981 +++$+++ u5913 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ SABENA PRESIDENT +++$+++ Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
L288980 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
L288979 +++$+++ u5913 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ SABENA PRESIDENT +++$+++ I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
L288818 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ There is one thing I need right away.
L288817 +++$+++ u5913 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ SABENA PRESIDENT +++$+++ Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
L288815 +++$+++ u5913 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ SABENA PRESIDENT +++$+++ Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
L288814 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
L288813 +++$+++ u5913 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ SABENA PRESIDENT +++$+++ Can I have your name again?
L289236 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
L289235 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What is this about no water?
L289221 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ As the trucks go.
L289220 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ When?
L289219 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
L289189 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
L289188 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L289187 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
L289030 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ Many beers.
L289029 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How much beer?
L289028 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
L289027 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where has all our beer gone?
L288962 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ The lieutenant wants the register.
L288961 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What are you doing?
L288918 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
L288917 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ What do we do with all these people?
L288812 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
L288811 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
L288771 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What! Paul storms off.
L288770 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ He has taken the presidential suite.
L288769 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
L288423 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How dead?
L288422 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ Twelve are dead.
L288411 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
L288410 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
L288389 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Many times.
L288388 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ You have taken business class?
L288387 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
L288386 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ That is why they call it coach?
L288385 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
L288384 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
L288383 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
L288382 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
L288381 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What's wrong?
L288380 +++$+++ u5916 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ZOZO +++$+++ Rutaganda's place?
L288960 +++$+++ u5910 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
L288959 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
L288958 +++$+++ u5910 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
L288957 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, thank you Mr. President.
L288956 +++$+++ u5910 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Paul, are you there?
L288953 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
L288952 +++$+++ u5910 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ The staff and guests! How many?
L288951 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The staff, the guests.
L288950 +++$+++ u5910 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ All. What do you mean all?
L288949 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
L288948 +++$+++ u5910 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Out? Where are you going?
L288947 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
L288946 +++$+++ u5910 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Paul. Are you alright?
L288527 +++$+++ u5912 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ On the street.
L288526 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where?
L288525 +++$+++ u5912 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ There are soldiers.
L288507 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Who is this Simon?
L288506 +++$+++ u5912 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Please, papa, I have a secret path.
L288505 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, I don't want you going on the street.
L288504 +++$+++ u5912 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
L288503 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why the hurry, Roger?
L288502 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thank you, Roger.
L288501 +++$+++ u5912 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
L288753 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Go downstairs, I will help you.
L288752 +++$+++ u5911 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ REFUGEE +++$+++ I don't know.
L288751 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What is his room number?
L288750 +++$+++ u5911 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ REFUGEE +++$+++ I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
L288749 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Can I help you?
L288748 +++$+++ u5911 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ REFUGEE +++$+++ Moses, Moses Seradungu.
