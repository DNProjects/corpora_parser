L588514 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
L588513 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
L588512 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I see you got the telegram.
L588447 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
L588446 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
L588369 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Okay.  What's the second thing?
L588368 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
L588367 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
L588366 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
L588363 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Damn...
L588362 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Did you bring along something to read?
L588360 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
L588359 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
L588358 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I wish you were coming with me.
L588357 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
L588356 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
L588355 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You've got everything?
L588308 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Whatever happens.
L588307 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You'll stand by me?
L588306 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I am, too.
L588305 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ What about you, Delly?
L588304 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
L588303 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
L588302 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
L588301 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
L588300 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I believe you.
L588298 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Thanks, I like it.  I think.
L588297 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
L588296 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
L588295 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
L588294 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
L588293 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
L588292 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
L588291 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Hi.
L588290 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Hi.
L588074 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ I had it, a minute ago...
L588073 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
L588057 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
L588056 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
L587903 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ It's possible.
L587902 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You mean,  me?
L587901 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
L587900 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ... including me.  Right?  
L587899 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
L587898 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Dad... 
L587897 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Well...
L587896 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
L587895 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ That always used to work.
L587894 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I think  it's worse  now.
L587887 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
L587886 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ That's my girl!  Did you...?
L587885 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
L587884 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ How'd it go?
L587883 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Delly?  In here.
L587882 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Dad?
L588264 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
L588263 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Delly, shhhhhh...
L588258 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
L588257 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I see...
L588256 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
L588255 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ What... do you remember?
L588123 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Guess I must've learned.
L588122 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
L588121 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Thanks.
L588120 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Your dancing's very good.
L588119 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's... pretty frightening.
L588118 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
L588117 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
L588104 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.
L588103 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
L588102 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Now, did you remember that, or...
L588101 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No kidding.
L588100 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Exactly.  And he got good.
L588099 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ ... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
L588098 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
L588097 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Huh.  That was nice of me.
L588096 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
L588095 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ My what?
L588094 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
L588093 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ They're not bad.
L588092 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh.
L588091 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
L588090 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I don't smoke?
L588089 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ When did you start smoking?
L588088 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Have you got a cigarette?
L588087 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Well, there's got to be a way...
L588086 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
L588085 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
L588084 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
L588083 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Nine hundred...
L588082 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
L588081 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
L588080 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh.
L588079 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
L588078 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What?
L588077 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ This is strange.  Do you feel it?
L588068 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ... and It's just... well, deja vu.
L588067 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh...
L588066 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
L588000 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
L587999 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Were we going to get married?
L587998 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I'm  fine.  Really.  
L587997 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Do you have the...
L587996 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Nothing.  
L587995 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What was that?
L587994 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Yes.  Hic!
L587993 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We were in love... weren't we?
L587992 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Yeah...
L587991 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
L587990 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
L587989 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L587988 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
L587987 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
L587985 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
L587984 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What did... what did I want to be?
L587983 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
L587982 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
L587981 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
L587980 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Whoa.
L587979 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ And why not?
L587978 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
L587977 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
L587976 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
L587975 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
L587973 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Through the door.  It comes apart.
L587972 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ How'd they get it inside?
L587971 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
L587969 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
L587968 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why me?
L587967 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You first.
L587966 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You must not remember anything. Come on.
L587965 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ City hall?
L587963 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well... where can we go?
L587962 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
L587956 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
L587955 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
L587954 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I did?  Huh!
L587953 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
L587952 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I do?
L587951 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You look... different.
L587950 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Me too.
L587949 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
L587948 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What.
L587944 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've seen you before.  Your picture...
L587943 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Do you... remember me?
L588437 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Well, then, as what did you go?
L588436 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
L588435 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
L588434 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm not refuting anything.
L588433 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
L588432 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No, sir.
L588431 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
L588427 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
L588426 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
L588425 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
L588422 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
L588421 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
L588420 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
L588419 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
L588418 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
L588417 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Start with what you knew then.
L588416 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
L588415 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
L588414 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes it does.
L588413 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
L588412 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes... yes, I do.
L588411 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
L588410 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
L588409 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
L588408 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
L588405 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ And what is the state of your memory now?
L588404 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes.
L588403 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
L588402 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
L588401 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
L588400 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
L588399 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L588398 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
L588397 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
L588396 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
L588395 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
L588394 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
L588393 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Sir, that is true.
L588458 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, you will...
L588457 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
L588456 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Go ahead, son.
L588455 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I... I need a drink of water.
L588454 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
L588443 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
L588442 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
L588439 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
L588438 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm a little hesitant to say.
L588386 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
L588385 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yes.  A prepared statement.
L588384 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ A statement?
L588383 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
L588382 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
L588381 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
L588380 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
L588379 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
L588378 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I do.
L588377 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
L587810 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
L587809 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
L587808 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, son, you're home!
L587807 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Here we are.
L587789 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Ben, when's Delly due back?
L587788 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Only one in town.  Get in, son.
L587757 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Listen to me!  The young man in there...
L587756 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
L587755 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
L587791 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
L587790 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
L587782 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
L587781 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Mother o'god...
L587779 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Shhhhhh.
L587778 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Are you saying that he's...
L587776 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ By all means.
L587775 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
L587763 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
L587762 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
L587761 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ No wallet, huh?
L588276 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
L588275 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
L587785 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The Bijou?
L587784 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
L587774 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
L587773 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Or the Bijou.  Either one.
L587772 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ "It's a Wonderful Life?"
L587771 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
L587770 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ "It's a Wonderful Life."
L587769 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ What's that?
L587768 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
L587767 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ But what?
L587766 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No.  But...
L587765 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
L587764 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes.
L588185 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
L588184 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
L588153 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
L588152 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ A super market.  Huh.
L588151 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
L588150 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
L588149 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
L588148 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
L588147 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
L588146 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
L588145 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
L588144 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Thanks.
L588143 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
L588142 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Good to meet you.  Again.
L588141 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
L588247 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
L588246 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're not going anywhere, Harry.
L588245 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
L588244 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Vultures...
L588243 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ A few.
L588242 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Anybody take it?
L588241 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
L588240 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
L588239 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Did I what?
L588238 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Did you... did you...
L588237 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm here.
L588231 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I know, I know... keep still.
L588230 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The film broke...
L588229 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jesus...
L588165 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
L588164 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Luke... what time is it?
L588162 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
L588161 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ ... what?
L588160 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ha!
L588159 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Dad, I...
L588158 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
L588157 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yes.
L588156 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Beautiful, wasn't it?
L588134 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, no, I...
L588133 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why don't you two get out there and dance?
L588050 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ They're...
L588049 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
L588046 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
L588045 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes?
L588044 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well...
L587960 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
L587959 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You bet.
L587958 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
L587957 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
L587924 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
L587923 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
L587911 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ ... Ernie.
L587910 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ernie.
L587881 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
L587880 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But I...
L587870 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
L587869 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
L587868 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
L587867 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
L587866 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes?
L587865 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
L587864 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
L587863 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ "February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
L587862 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
L587861 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
L587860 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
L587849 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
L587848 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
L587837 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
L587836 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh.  What... what time is it?
L587835 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This is the staff of the Bijou.
L587834 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Who... are they?
L587833 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ They couldn't wait to see you.
L587826 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, yes, that she was.  She certainly made this place a home.
L587825 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Mother.  She's beautiful.
L587824 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
L587821 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
L587820 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Didn't you have any help?
L587819 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
L587818 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why?
L587817 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
L587816 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
L587815 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Ah.
L587814 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ We've been closed for a while.
L587813 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Can't wait.
L587812 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wait'll you see the inside!
L587805 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Nine and-a-half years...
L587804 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Nine and-a-half years ago.
L587803 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
L587802 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ When did I leave?
L587801 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
L587798 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
L587797 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
L587796 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And... what's my name again?
L587795 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Harry, son.  Harry.
L587794 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
L587662 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Pete...
L587661 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ 'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
L587660 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
L587659 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Then I'll call you a cab.
L587658 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
L587657 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
L587656 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
L587655 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
L587654 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Sandra Sinclair.
L587653 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
L587652 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
L587651 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
L587650 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
L587649 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
L587648 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
L587647 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
L587646 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Zackly.
L587645 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ The G-man?
L587644 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
L587643 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What.
L587642 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
L587641 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
L587640 +++$+++ u3151 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
L587787 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ We live in a theater?
L587786 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ That's where you live.
L587754 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Wish I could say the same thing.
L587753 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ ... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
L587752 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
L587751 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ She's very pretty.
L587750 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
L587748 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
L587747 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Call me... Ishmael?
L587746 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ What is it?
L587745 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
L587744 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I... no, I... I just can't...
L587743 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
L587742 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ It's possible.  I just don't remember.
L587741 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
L587740 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Thanks.
L587739 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Here, one of mine.
L587738 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
L587737 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I guess I did.
L587736 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
L587735 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
L587734 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
L587733 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No, sir.
L587732 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Any idea how you got here, son?
L588235 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
L588234 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Can we get him to the hospital?
L588233 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
L588072 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ No, I'm not much of a dancer.
L588071 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Aren't you coming?
L588070 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ You kids off to the dance?
L588063 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
L588062 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
L588061 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What's wrong?
L588060 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Evening, Doctor Lardner.
L588059 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Evening, Luke.
L588030 +++$+++ u3161 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
L588029 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Take a hike.  Am-scray.
L588028 +++$+++ u3161 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Huh?
L588027 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
L588026 +++$+++ u3161 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Thirty a month.
L588025 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ What's his rent?
L588024 +++$+++ u3161 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
L588023 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Wouldn't blame him if he was.
L588022 +++$+++ u3161 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ You think he's drunk somewhere?
L588021 +++$+++ u3161 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Hey, it's the best way to tell.
L588020 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Jesus.
L588019 +++$+++ u3161 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
L588018 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ You smell gas?
L588498 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
L588497 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
L588496 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
L588495 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
L588494 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
L588493 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
L588492 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Well, that's not what they think.
L588491 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
L588490 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
L588489 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
L588488 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
L588487 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L588486 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
L588485 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
L588484 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
L588483 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Not at all.
L588482 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
L588481 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Why not?
L588480 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Not any more.
L588479 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
L588478 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Luke didn't smoke.
L588477 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ When'd you quit smoking?
L588476 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No thanks.
L588475 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Cigarette?
L588474 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble.
L588473 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm not sorry for what I said.
L588472 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
L588328 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
L588327 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ It's wrong, Leo.
L588326 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
L588325 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ That's not the country Luke fought for.
L588324 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
L588320 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
L588319 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Exactly.
L588318 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ And I won't be a communist anymore.
L588317 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
L588316 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
L588315 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
L587620 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
L587619 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
L587618 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ So, it is a blacklist.
L587617 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
L587616 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ "Ashes To Ashes?"
L587615 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
L587614 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yeah, well, that's enough.
L587613 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
L587611 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Why not?
L587610 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ You can't testify.
L587609 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
L587608 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
L587607 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Exactly.
L587606 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ I know.  A Purple Heart.
L587605 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I was decorated.
L587604 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
L587603 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
L587602 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
L587601 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
L587600 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
L587599 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
L587598 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ You should watch what you say.
L587597 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
L587596 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
L587595 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
L587594 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
L587593 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Who the hell is this "they?"
L587592 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
L587591 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I... I don't believe this.
L587590 +++$+++ u3153 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
L588225 +++$+++ u3155 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ MRS. TERWILLIGER +++$+++ You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
L588224 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What?
L588223 +++$+++ u3155 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ MRS. TERWILLIGER +++$+++ Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
L588201 +++$+++ u3155 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ MRS. TERWILLIGER +++$+++ Some of it might come back to you.
L588200 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No, I...
L588199 +++$+++ u3155 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ MRS. TERWILLIGER +++$+++ Sit.  Play with me.
L588198 +++$+++ u3155 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ MRS. TERWILLIGER +++$+++ Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
L588197 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I can play the piano?
L588196 +++$+++ u3155 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ MRS. TERWILLIGER +++$+++ I taught you that.
L588195 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That was beautiful.
L588137 +++$+++ u3155 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ MRS. TERWILLIGER +++$+++ Nineteen-oh-nine.
L588136 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ When was that?
L588135 +++$+++ u3155 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ MRS. TERWILLIGER +++$+++ I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
L588052 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh.
L588051 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ That's my r-r-rent.
L588016 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yeah... me too.
L588015 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
L588012 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Of course.
L588011 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
L588010 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
L588009 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Cat.
L588008 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
L588006 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
L588005 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Found me.
L587843 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
L587842 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ No.
L587841 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Is there a young Tim?
L588353 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here.
L588352 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I thought you...
L588351 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
L588350 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
L588349 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Oh...
L588348 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
L588347 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Oh.
L588346 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ It's about me.
L588345 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Oh.
L588344 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Tim, I have to tell you something.
L588343 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ They will.  They w-w-will.
L588342 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The customers?  I don't know...
L588341 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
L588340 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Thanks.
L588339 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Please, sit.
L588338 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
L588337 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
L587638 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
L587637 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Will you help me, Sandy?
L587634 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
L587633 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You mean, he was... let go, too?
L587632 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
L587631 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
L587630 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
L587629 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ That you got let go.
L587628 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ What exactly did you hear?
L587627 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ What happened?
L587574 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You bet, honey.
L587573 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
L587731 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
L587730 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
L587729 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
L587700 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Got any money?
L587699 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes.  Very.
L587698 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ You hungry, son?
L587696 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
L587695 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The war...
L587694 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
L587693 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ 'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
L587692 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ They all know you?
L587690 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
L587689 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I suppose.  Thanks.
L587688 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
L587687 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Ancestors?
L588286 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ All right.  All right.  We'll see.
L588285 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No.  Absolutely not.
L588284 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
L588282 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
L588281 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Would that be Miss Sinclair?
L588280 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ My girlfriend.  If she still is...
L588279 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Who?
L588278 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I already have.
L588277 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
