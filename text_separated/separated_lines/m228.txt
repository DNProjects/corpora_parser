L651584 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What are they doing?
L651508 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences.  It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them.
L651507 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He has a lot of hurt inside him.
L651506 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
L651505 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I haven't forgotten.
L651504 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
L651503 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We were idealists.
L651502 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Why did we begin this?
L651501 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
L651500 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I can take it.
L651499 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You may not like what you hear.
L651413 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
L651412 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Guilty.
L651411 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
L651410 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
L651409 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What?
L651408 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I am about this.
L651407 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You sound so sure.
L651406 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He knows.
L651405 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
L651403 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You miss him.
L651402 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
L651401 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Your father?
L651400 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He would have loved this.
L651093 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Yep.
L651092 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Looks like weather.
L650980 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
L650979 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
L650977 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Not yet.
L650976 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Did we lose anybody?
L651256 +++$+++ u3453 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Give me some time to Blow the man down!
L651255 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
L651254 +++$+++ u3453 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
L651253 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
L651249 +++$+++ u3453 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Give me some time to blow the man down...
L651248 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
L651247 +++$+++ u3453 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
L651246 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
L651645 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
L651644 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L651643 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Carry on.
L651100 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
L651099 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
L651079 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ We've got weather moving in from the west.
L651078 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Well, that's all part of it.
L651077 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
L651076 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Come in.
L651016 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
L651015 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I didn't know sir.
L651014 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
L650971 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
L650970 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
L650962 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
L650961 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
L650941 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Good.  Let's go sailing.
L650940 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
L650939 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Everyone aboard young Bill?
L651757 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Thank you.
L651756 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Fifteen.
L651755 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ How old are you, son?
L651754 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
L651753 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ But your instinct was to lose sail?
L651752 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Skipper called us out of the rigging.
L651751 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Why didn't you drop any sail?
L651799 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
L651798 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L651797 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ There's still a way.
L651718 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
L651717 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
L650909 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You came back, Tod.  You came back.
L650908 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
L650907 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
L651689 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ No, I can't.
L651688 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
L651683 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
L651682 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Fine.
L651680 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Okay.
L651679 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Why don't you go and try some of that on?
L651677 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
L651676 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
L651673 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
L651672 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Where's Mom?
L650799 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes sir.
L650798 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Make us proud.
L650813 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
L650812 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
L650805 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Whatever.
L650804 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
L650803 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Gieg, Chuck.
L650802 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
L650801 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yeah.
L650800 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Albatross?
L651611 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I feel like... we can do anything.
L651610 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Me either.
L651609 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You know, I never had friends like this.
L651608 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
L651607 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
L651606 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Figured what out?
L651605 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
L651604 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Anonymous.
L651603 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What was that?
L651602 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
L651601 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L651600 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Feels different doesn't it?
L651598 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
L651597 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I couldn't have done it without you.
L651596 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
L651595 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I just can't believe it.
L651594 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
L651593 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I know.
L651592 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
L651591 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What about you?
L651590 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Congratulations.
L651589 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Ninety-six.
L651588 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah.  How'd you do.
L651587 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You okay?
L651376 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
L651375 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Believe what?
L651374 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
L651331 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
L651330 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
L651325 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
L651324 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You're not a moron.
L651323 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
L651322 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What?
L651321 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
L651314 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way!
L651313 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
L651312 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
L651310 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ To take a piss.
L651309 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Where you going?
L651195 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
L651194 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yeah.
L651182 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
L651181 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's what they get for not locking the door.
L651180 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
L651171 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
L651170 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What do you mean?
L651169 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ She isn't that old.
L650778 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You don't give him enough credit Chas.
L650777 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ He does.
L650776 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Nobody says you have to be like me.
L650775 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
L650774 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Because it looks good.
L650773 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why then.
L650772 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ That's not why he's sending me.
L650771 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I thought this was your dream come true.
L650770 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It's not a vacation, it's private school.
L650769 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
L650768 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
L650767 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
L651744 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I know enough.
L651743 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
L651742 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I gotta go.
L651741 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Is it true Phil?
L651740 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Well that's just typical isn't it?
L651739 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
L651736 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I guess.
L651735 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Can we talk?
L651457 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
L651456 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You only hurt yourself you know?
L651455 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What's the difference?
L651454 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Why'd you do it?
L651352 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Like this!
L651351 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
L651296 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Shut up, Phil.
L651295 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
L651225 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It was a bad dream...
L651224 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Hey, shut up will ya?
L651803 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
L651802 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ But that's not the point...
L651801 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
L651800 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
L651524 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I'm pissin' fire man.
L651523 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ We all have problems.
L651522 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Listen man, I think I have a problem.
L651213 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
L651212 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Sorry to here it.
L650797 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ I know you will.
L650796 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
L650795 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Look, I just better go.
L650794 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ Passport?
L650793 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes.
L650792 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ Do you have your ticket?
L650788 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Me too.
L650787 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
L650786 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L650785 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
L651474 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What are you talking about.
L651473 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't go in there.
L651337 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't make it out?
L651336 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What are they doing?
L651237 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I couldn't.
L651236 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Jesus, you never told them?
L651235 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
L651234 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Who?
L651233 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ That's how he died you know.
L651231 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
L651230 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It works?
L651229 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ My dad.
L651228 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Who told you that?
L651227 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
L651226 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It was so real...
L651211 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
L651210 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
L651209 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where are you from any way?
L651191 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ 'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
L651190 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ How do you know?  They might.
L651189 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ My parents don't do it anymore.
L651186 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
L651185 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What'd you do?
L651184 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
L651183 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ So... What happened?
L651177 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Come on man, what'd they look like?
L651176 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ No way!
L651168 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
L651167 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Ya know... "It".
L651166 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Do what?
L651165 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You think Skipper and Alice do it?
L651067 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
L651066 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
L651065 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
L651064 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Forget it.
L651063 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I feel like I got you into this.
L651062 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I just brought you something to eat.
L651061 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
L651060 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Good.
L651059 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Fine.
L651058 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ How ya doing?
L650879 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't watch this.
L650878 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Jesus.
L650860 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Maybe it's an air raid.
L650859 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What the hell is going on?
L651497 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
L651496 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I don't know.
L651495 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Does Phil know how you guys feel?
L651492 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
L651491 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ They have every right Chuck.
L651490 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
L651489 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
L651488 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Of a fight he can't win out here.
L651487 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Of what?
L651486 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ The Dolphin was a symptom.
L651485 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ He killed the dolphin.
L651484 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Why do you think I'm sending him home?
L651483 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Close the door.  Sit down.
L651482 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Sir...?
L651481 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Can't do it.
L651480 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
L651479 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Well, spit it out.
L651478 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
L651477 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What's on your mind?
L651088 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
L651087 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Shouldn't we turn away?
L651084 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
L651083 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
L651082 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Uh, huh.
L651045 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Face what?
L651044 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
L651009 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It was my fault.  I slipped.
L651008 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You all right?
L650973 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ All stop on the engine.
L650972 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L650969 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Unfurl the squares!
L650968 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Northeast sir!
L650967 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Speak up boy!
L650966 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Ah... Northeast... sir.
L650945 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  I want to know that you've heard and understand.  Raise the mainsail.
L650944 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes sir.
L650943 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
L651558 +++$+++ u3457 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
L651557 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
L651556 +++$+++ u3457 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Stow away?
L651555 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Your cannons made a compelling argument.
L651554 +++$+++ u3457 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ But you invited is aboard.
L651553 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ So is violating international law.
L651552 +++$+++ u3457 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Chicken is a fool's game captain.
L651813 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ No.
L651812 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
L651811 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
L651810 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ Then what do you think he was trying to do.
L651809 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ No.
L651808 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ Is that what you were trained to do?
L651807 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Twice.
L651806 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
L651805 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
L651804 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
L651367 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
L651366 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What is it we can do for you today?
L651365 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
L651364 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ And, of course, we are.
L651363 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
L650936 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ He's a big boy.
L650935 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
L650934 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Take good care of my son.
L650933 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ It will be more than that, I can promise you.
L650932 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
L650931 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
L650930 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
L650929 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
L650928 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
L650927 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ As you can see, there's a lot to do.
L650926 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
L650923 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I know.
L650922 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
L650921 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
L650920 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
L651738 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
L651737 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Who is it Philip?
L651399 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
L651398 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
L651397 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It has nothing to do with him.
L651396 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
L651394 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
L651393 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Oh, really?
L651392 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I can take care of myself.
L651391 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Spying?!
L651388 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Why are you here?
L651387 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
L651386 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I should be eating with the crew.
L651385 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ What's wrong, you don't like steak?
L651543 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
L651542 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
L651534 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ She's Cuban.
L651533 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jesus.  She's got guns.
L651273 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ They'll know about it in the morning.
L651272 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's that?
L651271 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
L651270 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And being sixteen.
L651269 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
L651268 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Immortality.
L651252 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ A padlock.
L651251 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's that?
L651250 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
L651245 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
L651244 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Son-of-a-bitch.
L651243 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
L651242 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You're officer of the watch, George.
L651241 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?!  What's happening?!!
L651053 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
L651052 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes sir.
L651051 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
L651050 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.  I do.
L651049 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You do?
L651048 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I think you were too hard on Weathers.
L651432 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
L651431 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
L651334 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Why would you do that?
L651333 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Me, too.
L651327 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I can show you how to use a slide rule.
L651326 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
L651293 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
L651292 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We'll think of something.
L651291 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
L651290 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's enough.
L651289 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
L651281 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
L651280 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
L651318 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't have to listen to this.
L651317 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why, man?
L651197 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
L651196 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It matters to me.
L651193 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I figured it out.
L651192 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ They tell you that?
L651179 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
L651178 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
L651175 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
L651174 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What?  Come on...
L651173 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Trust me donut.  I know.
L651172 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ How would you know?
L651122 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Like you'd know what to do with one.
L651121 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
L650996 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shut up donut.
L650995 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
L650905 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Come on, he didn't mean anything.
L650904 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Don't ever call me stupid.
L650899 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
L650898 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I couldn't do it.
L650897 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
L650896 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why'd you jump?
L650895 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's your problem?
L651438 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
L651437 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
L651436 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
L651005 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
L651004 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L651003 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What is it... the secret?
L651002 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
L650998 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ You know what he is talking about here?
L650997 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
L650992 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
L650991 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ That's not a satisfactory answer.
L650870 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
L650869 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't.
L651560 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
L651559 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
L651551 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
L651550 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
L651549 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What's that?
L651548 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ We've got a problem.
L651086 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
L651085 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ What do you think?
L650958 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Outer.
L650957 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ Tie it off!!
L650954 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ It seems we're short on singers.
L650953 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
L650938 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
L650937 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ Well, that was neighborly.
L651461 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ About anything.
L651460 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ About yourself?
L651459 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It hurts too much to care.
L651458 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
L651442 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
L651441 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
L651340 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What?
L651339 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
L651141 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
L651140 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
L651434 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Son of a bitch!!
L651433 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
L651428 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
L651427 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It's outta here!
L651426 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
L651425 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No way Phil.  Not like this.
L651424 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
L651423 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Phil.  What are you doing?
L651350 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
L651349 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ But, they don't speak English.
L651348 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You've gotta be kidding?
L651347 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What are we supposed to talk about?
L651329 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Long enough.
L651328 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ How long you been standing there?
L651449 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
L651448 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm not gonna kill it.
L651220 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
L651219 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Joy, rapture...
L651218 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
L651095 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm not staying out here.
L651094 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
L651043 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
L651042 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No, sir.
L651022 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Then keep your mouth shut.
L651021 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No.
L651020 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Do you have something to say?
L650984 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
L650983 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Suicidal...
L650925 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Sir.
L650924 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
L651036 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
L651035 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
L651034 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Are you hating this?!  Are you!
L651033 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Aaauuuhhh!!!
L651032 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
L651031 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't.
L651030 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
L651028 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I don't know...
L651027 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What are you blubbering about?
L651025 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Sorry won't cut it.
L651024 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L651023 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What's it going to be?
L651019 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Up you go.  Right now.
L651018 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What?
L651017 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Swing up, son.
L651792 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
L651791 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Yes.
L651788 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
L651787 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
L651786 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Yes, that's true.
L651785 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ ... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
L651784 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ For killing a dolphin.
L651783 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
L651782 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ They are much more than that, sir.
L651781 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
L651780 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
L651779 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
L651778 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I can't be sure.
L651777 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ What makes you so sure it was one?
L651776 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ No.
L651771 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Yes, I was.
L651770 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
L651767 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
L651766 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He climbed when he was ready.
L651765 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
L651821 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Then what are you trying to say then?
L651820 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
L651819 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
L651773 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ No.  I didn't.
L651772 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ And you didn't do anything about it?
L651701 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I am accountable.
L651700 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
L651699 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ ... Absolutely not.
L651698 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
L651696 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
L651695 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
L651694 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ It wasn't hard.
L651693 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
L651692 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ May I ask you something?
L651691 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I understand.
L651690 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
L651714 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
L651713 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
L651712 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
L651711 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?!
L651710 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Easy for you to say.
L651379 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
L651378 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
L651377 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
