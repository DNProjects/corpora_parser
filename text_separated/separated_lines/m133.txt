L378603 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
L378602 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ What's the line?
L378600 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Good. I don't want to be late.
L378599 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
L378598 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You want me to go up with you?
L378597 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Apartment 306.
L378596 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
L378595 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
L378594 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Where's the stereo?
L378589 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
L378588 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
L378587 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ No shit! He's good!
L378586 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
L378585 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
L378584 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
L378583 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
L378582 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, okay.
L378581 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
L378580 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
L378579 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
L378519 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Deal.
L378518 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Dinner's on you.
L378517 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You're my hero.
L378516 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Floor seats.
L378433 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
L378432 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
L378431 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Not that we know of.
L378430 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
L378429 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ I don't know.
L378428 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
L378427 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ No -- you can't do that.
L378423 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
L378422 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ SWAT wants to go in.
L378421 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ They're not usually graduate students.
L378418 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
L378417 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hello, guys.
L378624 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Clarence Teal.
L378623 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ This cousin of yours... What's his name?
L378622 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
L378619 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Of course.
L378618 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Could I please have a little water?
L378615 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
L378614 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
L378613 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
L378612 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Where did you find an old recording like that?
L378611 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
L378610 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
L378608 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
L378607 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ What happened? Is there a problem?
L378606 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
L378605 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Who is it?
L379024 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
L379023 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I won't get away with it.
L379022 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
L379021 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Don't make do it, Mike.
L379018 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
L379017 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
L379016 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
L378692 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
L378691 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
L378690 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
L378688 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You don't want to know.
L378687 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What happened, Mike.
L378686 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
L378685 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
L378684 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
L378683 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
L378682 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
L379095 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Is that where you're family lives?
L379094 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I hate fucking Springfield.
L379093 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
L379092 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
L379091 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
L379090 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Tell my dad.
L379079 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Huh?
L379078 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
L379077 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
L379076 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ How can I help you with the particles?
L379075 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
L379074 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Tell me what's wrong.
L379072 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ They want Walter dead!
L379071 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ This has nothing to do with Walter.
L379070 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
L379069 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Who's controlling your mind?
L379066 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ You can't help me, man.
L379065 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
L378493 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You got it.
L378492 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Automatic.
L378491 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Manual or automatic?
L378489 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You want a convertible or hardtop?
L378488 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What?!
L378481 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You're gettin' the car.
L378480 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Am I gettin' the car?
L378479 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
L378465 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
L378464 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Really?
L378453 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Then where's my FUCKING car!
L378452 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
L378444 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I need to get something straight first.
L378443 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Where's the car?
L379168 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Wait a minute, lemme see that.
L379167 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
L379166 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I what?
L379165 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ You signed out twice.
L379164 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Is there a problem?
L379163 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ Hold on a second here.
L379157 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ Johnny who?
L379156 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
L379155 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ Who are you again?
L378703 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Roper, we're into it...
L378702 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
L378701 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Roper...
L378700 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
L378699 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Being faxed over now.
L378698 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
L378697 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
L378696 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What do you got on Korda?
L378647 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Solis said to keep you clear of this.
L378646 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Anything on Korda so far?
L378426 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I have to go face to face.
L378425 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
L378424 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
L378416 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Earl.
L378415 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What's the suspect's name?
L378414 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ That's right.
L378413 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
L378412 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
L378411 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ ...a car.
L378410 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
L378409 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
L378408 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Hi, Roper.
L379248 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
L379247 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ That's not going to look too good on your service record.
L379246 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah.
L379245 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
L379240 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Spread it out.
L379239 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's all there.
L379238 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
L379237 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Satisfied?
L379236 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
L379235 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
L379234 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Open your shirt.
L378979 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
L378978 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You can't kill me like this.
L378930 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I'll give you something.
L378929 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
L378928 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ No. You just do shit for me right now.
L378927 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
L378926 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ For now that's all.
L378925 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Is that all?
L378924 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
L378923 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
L378922 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yep.
L378921 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Are you in charge, Roper?
L378918 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
L378917 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
L378916 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
L378915 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You don't have to come here.
L379284 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Stay put.
L379283 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
L379282 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ McCall, you all right?
L379215 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Good question.
L379214 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
L379205 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
L379204 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That's a chance I gotta take.
L379203 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ So what do you want to do?
L379202 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
L379116 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You've got to decide that for yourself.
L379115 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And what if you can't live with it?
L379114 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
L379113 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And what about the ones you don't save?
L379112 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
L379111 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ How many have you lost?
L379110 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That it is.
L379109 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
L379108 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
L379107 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
L379106 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It might have happened no matter who was up there.
L378973 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Pull up alongside.
L378972 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You're crazy.
L378971 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
L378970 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What the fuck is going on.
L378962 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Damnit!
L378961 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ He's got the girl.
L378953 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And doing a very good job of it.
L378952 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He's cutting down the visibility.
L378951 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ There's your answer. He's smart.
L378904 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Police corruption. It's everywhere.
L378903 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
L378898 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Occasionally you lose.
L378897 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Is it always like this?
L378896 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ About six years. My partner took me.
L378895 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ How long you been coming here?
L378892 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
L378891 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How much you wanna bet?
L378890 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We won.
L378889 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We lost.
L378888 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We won!
L378887 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ COME ON, RUSSELL!
L378886 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ The jockey!
L378885 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
L378883 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, first and second.
L378882 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ They need to run first and second?
L378880 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He'll be running at the quarter pole.
L378879 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ The 6 horse is still last.
L378877 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ To run late!
L378876 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ To run last?
L378875 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That's okay. That's his style.
L378874 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ The 6 horse is last.
L378871 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
L378870 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Still needs work.
L378869 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm just practicing my lying.
L378868 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
L378867 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ So what do you want?... An autograph.
L378866 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
L378865 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ronnie... Yeah, so.
L378863 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Fine.
L378862 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
L378859 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I do.
L378858 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
L378857 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
L378856 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I have two words for you... Seek help.
L378855 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
L378852 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You're a compulsive gambler?
L378851 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You know why I like the track?
L378850 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
L378849 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Why did he do it?
L378846 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
L378845 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What did you see?
L378843 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Okay, stop.
L378842 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
L378840 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
L378839 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ To save lives.
L378838 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Why?
L378837 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Yes.
L378836 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
L378835 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You tell me.
L378833 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Thou shall have no other God before me.
L378832 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What's the first commandment?
L378831 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Yes.
L378830 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You know the ten commandments?
L378829 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ It's against my nature.
L378828 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Get good at it.
L378827 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm not good at lying.
L378826 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
L378825 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
L378824 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
L378823 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ So what do I say to this guy?
L378822 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
L378820 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
L378819 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I can't do that.
L378818 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
L378817 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Tell me what you need.
L378814 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It'll come. Try again.
L378813 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ No.
L378812 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
L378807 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I think so.
L378806 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You think you can learn, McCall?
L378803 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
L378802 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I think I can handle that one.
L378801 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
L378800 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
L378799 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Around. Barnett's tough competition.
L378798 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Where did you hear that?
L378797 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
L378796 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
L378795 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Do you really?
L378794 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
L378793 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Every couple of months, huh?
L378792 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We see each other every couple of months.
L378791 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
L378790 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
L378789 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ She grow up in Livingtston, too?
L378788 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
L378787 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Explain how that works.
L378786 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
L378785 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You living together?
L378784 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
L378783 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I don't gamble.
L378782 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
L378780 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Why? You like my ass?
L378779 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You got a girlfriend?
L378778 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Well, if I have to, I have to.
L378777 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You have to. It's a tradition.
L378776 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I don't really like to drink.
L378775 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Come on. Let's go for a drink.
L378772 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Not the ones I'm at.
L378771 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
L378734 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We could fill it with water.
L378733 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How are we gonna get him out of there?
L378728 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L378727 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Is there something wrong with that?
L378726 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
L378725 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
L378724 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
L378723 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ It was okay.
L378722 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How did you like Toronto?
L378721 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
L378720 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You'd never been out of New York?
L378719 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
L378718 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You don't like New York?
L378717 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Furthest point I could find from New York.
L378716 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
L378715 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ National Marksman Competition.
L378714 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Recruited you from where?
L378713 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
L378712 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
L378708 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
L378707 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
L378578 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
L378577 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What's the point of this?
L378574 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Try to remember that.
L378573 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I know.
L378572 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
L378571 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I've rarely shot anyone.
L378570 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It rarely has to be done.
L378569 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Like it had to be done.
L378568 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How do you feel after a shooting.
L378567 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Only at the very end.
L378566 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You ever been in a hostage situation?
L378562 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ If you say so.
L378561 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
L378559 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Sorry... Habit.
L378558 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
L378557 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
L378556 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
L378555 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
L378739 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
L378738 +++$+++ u2062 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ OFFICER #1 +++$+++ Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
L378737 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Is the hostage injured?
L378736 +++$+++ u2062 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ OFFICER #1 +++$+++ Only that floor.
L378735 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Have you evacuated anyone?
L378731 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Which apartment?
L378730 +++$+++ u2062 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ OFFICER #1 +++$+++ Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
L378729 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
L378764 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ My name's Scott Roper.
L378763 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
L378762 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
L378761 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ And why the fuck would you do that for me?
L378760 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
L378759 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
L378758 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
L378756 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
L378755 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
L378754 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ She's the one to blame. Not me.
L378753 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
L378752 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I ain't interested in your life story.
L378751 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
L378750 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Let me show you something, Ray.
L378749 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
L378748 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
L378747 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
L378746 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I know how you feel, Ray.
L379315 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
L379314 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Prude.
L379313 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ The hell I am!
L379312 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
L379311 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You crazy? With all those people around?
L379309 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You thought I was talking about getting married?!
L379308 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
L379307 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
L379306 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
L379305 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ ...the hell are you talking about?
L379304 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
L379303 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scott...
L379302 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
L379301 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
L379300 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ A deeper level?
L379299 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
L379298 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
L379297 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah.
L379296 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
L379295 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hmm?
L379294 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I've been thinking.
L379293 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hmm?
L379292 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie?
L379289 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
L379288 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
L379281 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Do it!
L379280 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie...
L379279 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Stay here, don't move.
L379278 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's all over, babe, it's all over.
L379277 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie, Scottie...
L379189 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
L379188 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
L379185 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Use your imagination.
L379184 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
L379181 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ And you think he'll...
L379180 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Korda escaped.
L379171 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ In Europe women find older men very sexy.
L379170 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
L379135 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ ...Let me just show you.
L379134 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L379133 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
L379132 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ There is?
L379131 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
L379130 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's very nice.
L379129 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You like this place?
L379027 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
L379026 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ How's Paco doing?
L379012 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Just now.
L379011 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ When?
L379010 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's okay. We broke up.
L379009 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
L379008 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
L379007 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
L379006 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
L379005 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
L379002 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie...
L379001 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
L379000 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah that's it.
L378999 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
L378998 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Mmm, needs a little something.
L378997 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What do you think?
L378995 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ And it's hard to get.
L378994 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I've been craving that stuff all week.
L378993 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
L378992 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
L378988 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I was going to catch the last half on TV.
L378987 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's already started.
L378986 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I do.
L378985 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You got a bet on the game tonight?
L378984 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I wanted to get this out of the way.
L378674 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ronnie...
L378673 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ If you did, you never showed it.
L378672 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You think I didn't need you?
L378671 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
L378670 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Something I guess I can't have anymore.
L378669 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L378668 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
L378667 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I've proved that, didn't I?
L378666 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scott, You can't save everyone.
L378665 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
L378664 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
L378663 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
L378659 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
L378658 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That a new picture?
L378657 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Can I come in?
L378656 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm sorry.
L378655 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You heard.
L378654 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Maybe you should be.
L378653 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm not drunk. Yet.
L378652 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
L378651 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
L378650 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Hey.
L378512 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
L378511 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Please. I'm begging you.
L378510 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ This Greg is really getting in my way.
L378509 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
L378508 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
L378507 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
L378506 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
L378505 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
L378504 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Greg.
L378503 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
L378502 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You worship yourself.
L378501 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I worship you.
L378500 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
L378499 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
L378407 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ SHIT!
L378406 +++$+++ u2067 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ TRACK ANNOUNCER +++$+++ Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
L378405 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Where's the damn wire?!
L378404 +++$+++ u2067 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ TRACK ANNOUNCER +++$+++ Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
L378403 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Stay up there, Girl...
L378402 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
L378401 +++$+++ u2067 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ TRACK ANNOUNCER +++$+++ It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
L378396 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
L378395 +++$+++ u2067 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ TRACK ANNOUNCER +++$+++ ...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
L378965 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Come on!
L378964 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Yeah, they are but...
L378963 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Are these yours?
L378911 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
L378910 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What have you promised them?
L378909 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
L378908 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Any verification on numbers.
L378907 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
L378906 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What do we got?
L378643 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
L378642 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Who's running it!
L378641 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Roper...
L378640 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Who's running it?
L378639 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
L378638 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I want to be put on this case.
L378637 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ I can't do that.
L378636 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
L378635 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
L378553 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
L378552 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ I'll provide you with transportation.
L378551 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Repoed this morning.
L378550 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ What happened to your Trans Am?
L378549 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ The car is part of the deal.
L378548 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
L378547 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
L378546 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
L378545 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ And a car.
L378544 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Okay, I think I could swing that.
L378543 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
L378542 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ What do you think would be in order?
L378541 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
L378540 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
L378539 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
L378538 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ You let us worry about that.
L378537 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
L378533 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
L378532 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
L378531 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
L378530 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Your concern is heartwarming.
L378529 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
L378528 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Define concern.
L378527 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
L378526 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Depends. What's up?
L378525 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Are you going to make this hard for me?
L378524 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What?
L378523 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ Roper.
L378522 +++$+++ u2066 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ SOLIS +++$+++ He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
L378521 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Tell him to give me a raise.
