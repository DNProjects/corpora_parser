L332223 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ - - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
L332222 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
L332221 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
L332003 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Where did the vehicles stop?
L332002 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Phones are out too.
L331990 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ The monitors are failing.
L331989 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
L331988 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
L331987 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What now?
L331986 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
L331975 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
L331974 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ The door security systems are shutting down.
L331973 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What?
L331964 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
L331963 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
L331962 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
L331957 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
L331956 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
L331917 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Damn!
L331916 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
L331912 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ It's not worth taking the chance, John.
L331911 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You're sure we have to?
L331910 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
L331879 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Stop the program!  Stop the program!
L331878 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
L332242 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ 'Bout thirty seconds.
L332241 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How long will this take?
L332232 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
L332231 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How would we cut off the lysine?
L332230 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
L332226 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
L332225 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But would we get the phones back?
L332220 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
L332219 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
L332077 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
L332076 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Uh - - about two million.
L332075 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How many lines of code are there?
L332074 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What one?
L332073 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
L332072 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
L331626 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
L331625 +++$+++ u6162 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ DODGSON +++$+++ I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
L331624 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
L331623 +++$+++ u6162 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ DODGSON +++$+++ Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
L331622 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ What?  No menthol?
L331620 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ How am I supposed to transport them?
L331619 +++$+++ u6162 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ DODGSON +++$+++ Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
L331618 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ Oh, I'll get 'em all.
L331616 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
L331615 +++$+++ u6162 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ DODGSON +++$+++ You shouldn't use my name.
L331950 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
L331949 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
L331887 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
L331886 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
L331883 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
L331882 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
L331781 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
L331780 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
L331676 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Shhhhh!
L331675 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
L331952 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
L331951 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
L331907 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
L331906 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
L331905 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Pretty sure.
L331904 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Are you sure?
L331903 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
L331902 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
L331901 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ They are?  I'll be damned.
L331900 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ These are dilated.  Take a look.
L331899 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
L331898 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Six weeks?
L331897 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
L332312 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
L332311 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
L332310 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
L332286 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Look.
L332285 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
L332284 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why?
L332283 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But you know, I should  really be the one going .
L332274 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ John....
L332273 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
L332192 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
L332191 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Once we have control again we - -
L332190 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
L332189 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
L332188 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
L332187 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
L332186 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
L332185 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Carousel.
L332184 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
L332183 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
L331747 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
L331746 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
L331744 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
L331743 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh my God.
L331742 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Fascinating animals, fascinating.
L331714 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Could I have a tissue please?
L331713 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh my God.
L331712 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ There you are.  Out you come.
L331598 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
L331597 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I have samples all over the kitchen. 
L331596 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
L331595 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Did I say jerk?
L332361 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
L332360 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
L332359 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You can't hold it by yourself!
L332358 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
L332351 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
L332350 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
L331954 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
L331953 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Are you sure?
L331948 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
L331947 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - and swallows fresh ones.
L331946 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ - - barfs them up - -
L331945 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
L331944 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ - - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
L331943 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - a gizzard - -
L331942 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ - - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
L331941 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - like birds - -
L331938 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
L331937 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ - - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
L331936 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
L331931 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L331930 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Not just every six weeks.
L331929 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Constantly sick.
L331926 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I know.
L331925 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
L331894 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's my favorite.
L331893 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
L331831 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Dilophosaurus.
L331830 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, shit.
L331691 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
L331690 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
L331670 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We're out of a job.
L331669 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So what are you thinking?
L331665 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
L331664 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ We were right!
L331663 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
L331659 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Say again?
L331658 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
L331653 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
L331652 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
L331651 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The - - agility.  You're right!
L331650 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The movement!
L331607 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What kind of park is it?
L331606 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why would they care what we think?
L331600 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Small versions of adults, honey.
L331599 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And what are those?
L331594 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Sattler.
L331593 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
L331592 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay, who's the jerk?
L331582 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
L331581 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
L331580 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Anything else, you old fossil?
L331579 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The Cretaceous.
L331578 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The what?
L331577 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
L331576 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
L331575 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
L331574 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
L331573 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They smell.
L331572 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Cheap, cheap, cheap.
L331571 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
L331570 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
L331569 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?

L331560 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
L331559 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
L331543 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
L331542 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
L331541 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
L331540 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The taphonomy sure looks that way.
L331539 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ They died together?
L331538 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
L332305 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Like hell it is!
L332304 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ It's all right.
L332303 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
L332302 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why not?
L332301 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ No. We can't.
L332300 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
L332299 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ C'mon on, this way.
L332298 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
L332297 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh my God.  Aw, God.
L332296 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Stick to my heels.
L332295 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay, I'm on channel two.
L332288 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
L332287 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Come on, let's go.
L332280 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay.
L332279 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ I'm going with you.
L332277 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
L332276 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
L332228 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What's that?
L332227 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
L332136 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ They're not here.
L332135 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan?!
L332134 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ I don't know.
L332133 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Do you see anything?
L332132 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan!
L332131 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Dr. Grant!
L332130 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The other car!
L332129 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Ellie, com one!!
L332128 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No, no, no!
L332127 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
L331758 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
L331757 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The fences are electrified, right?
L331756 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
L332248 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
L332247 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ - - shut up.
L332246 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes?
L332238 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
L332237 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
L332148 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
L332147 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
L332146 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
L332145 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Faster, faster!
L332124 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Please - - chance it.
L332123 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Can we chance moving him?
L331909 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L331908 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Dino droppings?
L331874 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan?
L331873 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
L331872 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan?
L331871 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
L331870 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Unpredictability....
L331869 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
L331868 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, imperfections?
L331867 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ - - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
L331866 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan, listen to this.
L331865 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
L331864 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
L331862 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
L331861 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm still not clear on Chaos.
L331860 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
L331851 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
L331850 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
L331735 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Anti-nature.
L331734 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It's anti-nature.
L331733 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
L331732 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ And scary.
L331731 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And scary.
L331730 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I know, it's very exciting.
L331729 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I get ah - -
L331728 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That's right.  Will break through.
L331639 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
L331638 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No.
L331536 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
L331535 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Why not?
L331534 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
L331533 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
L331530 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
L331529 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
L331528 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
L331527 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
L331526 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
L331525 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ He sends his apologies.
L331524 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ What's this I hear at the airportä Hammond's not even here?
L331523 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ Hola, bienvenido
L331522 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Hola, Juanito
L332023 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
L332022 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Yeah.
L332021 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Are they heavy?
L332020 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ In a box under my seat.
L332019 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Hey!  Where did you find those things?
L332015 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
L332014 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
L332013 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Up and down, up and down!
L331829 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Dilophosaurus.
L331828 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ What are we looking for?
L331827 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I can't see.
L331799 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
L331798 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Hey!  Where are the brakes?
L331797 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
L331785 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Thank you.
L331784 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
L331766 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
L331765 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
L331764 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ - - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
L331763 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
L331762 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
L331761 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
L331701 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
L331700 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ John, we - - what I'm just saying....
L331689 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
L331688 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
L331645 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
L331644 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
L331643 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
L331642 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
L332330 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
L332329 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
L332325 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
L332324 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
L332323 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Go, go, go, jump!
L332320 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
L332319 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I can't!  I'm scared!
L332290 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Nope.
L332289 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
L332216 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Amphibian DNA.
L332215 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
L332214 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
L332201 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
L332200 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
L332199 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
L332198 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
L332197 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
L332177 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
L332176 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You got me.
L332175 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
L332174 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
L332173 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What do you call a blind dinosaur?
L332170 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
L332169 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Straight-A brainiac!
L332160 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ "Thunder lizard!"
L332159 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
L332107 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Maybe -- it's hard to say.
L332106 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I doubt it.
L332105 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
L332104 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ That's a good idea.
L332103 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ 'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
L332100 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
L332099 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ So am I going to help you with your foot?
L332098 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
L332097 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
L332096 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ No.
L332095 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
L332094 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Yes it is.
L332093 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
L332092 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
L332091 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I threw up.
L332057 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
L332056 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
L332055 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim, are you okay?
L332054 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
L331928 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
L331927 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ These look kind of familiar.
L331885 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Really?
L331884 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ And his book was a lot fatter than yours.

L331811 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Tim.
L331810 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Listen, ahh - -
L331809 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
L331805 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Oh, yeah - - great.
L331804 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I read your book.
L332048 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ There's gotta be something - -
L332047 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What?  What can we do?
L332046 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We gotta do something.
L332045 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Oh my God!
L332039 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Relatively.
L332038 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You're sure?!
L332037 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
L332032 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ When you gotta go, you gotta go.
L332031 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Where does he think he's going?
L332012 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Fine.
L332011 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I know.
L332010 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I didn't say you were scared.
L332009 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I didn't say I was scared.
L332008 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
L332007 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Kids get scared.
L332006 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
L332005 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ The kids okay?
L332004 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.

L331984 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You want to talk about this?
L331983 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Yeah, they hate me.
L331982 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Machines hate you?
L331981 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
L331980 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
L331979 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What'd I touch?!
L331978 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
L331977 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Why?
L331976 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
L331970 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
L331969 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You're married?
L331968 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
L331967 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You got any kids?
L331924 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
L331923 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You have no idea.
L331922 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
L331674 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Not without massive sequence gaps!
L331673 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
L331628 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Try to!
L331627 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ So you two dig up dinosaurs?
L332373 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
L332372 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
L331789 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What does he mean by "target audience"?
L331788 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
L331787 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Who?
L331786 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Ah - - they're here.
L331755 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
L331754 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
L331750 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
L331749 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
L331717 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Wu?
L331716 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
L331696 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Let's get outta here!
L331695 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
L331694 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Can't you stop these things?!
L331657 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
L331656 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
L331655 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
L331654 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
L331612 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ For a further three years.
L331611 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
L331610 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
L331609 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
L331608 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
L331605 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
L331604 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What kind of opinions?
L331603 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
L331602 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
L331601 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
L331589 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
L331588 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And who in God's name do you think you are....?
L331587 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ For today, I guarantee it.
L331586 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Hey, we were saving that!
L332366 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
L332365 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What works?
L332346 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Yes.
L332345 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
L332337 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
L332336 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
L332335 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
L332334 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
L332333 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
L332328 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
L332327 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
L332326 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
L332318 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
L332317 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
L332270 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
L332269 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Let's go!
L332268 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
L332267 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Please!
L332266 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Watch how it eats!
L332218 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
L332217 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ What's that?
L332203 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You're a beautiful big animal.
L332202 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I like cows.
L332195 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
L332194 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Go away!
L332181 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ All night.
L332180 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ All night?
L332179 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'll stay awake.
L332178 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
L332172 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
L332171 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
L332168 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Dorkatops!
L332167 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
L332166 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Oh, I hate the other kind.
L332165 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim, Tim, Tim....
L332153 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
L332152 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
L332114 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Alright.
L332113 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
L332112 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ It's safe.
L332111 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's safe.
L332110 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ It's safe?
L332109 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
L332108 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
L332089 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
L332088 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ He left us!  He left us!
L332087 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
L332086 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Dad - - Dad - -
L332059 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Let's get you out.
L332058 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
L332053 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
L332052 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim!  Lex!
L332255 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
L332254 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
L332244 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
L332243 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
L331779 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
L331778 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
L331777 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
L331776 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
L331775 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
L331774 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
L331772 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
L331771 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
L331723 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
L331722 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Your silence intrigues me.
L331637 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
L331636 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Don't do that!
L331635 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ John, John.
L331634 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thatπs all it is!
L331633 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
L331632 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
L331631 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
L331630 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
L331629 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
L331844 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ Thanks, Dad.
L331843 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
L331842 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
L331841 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
L331840 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
L331839 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
L331838 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
L332079 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Sure.
L332078 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
L332070 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ There's no sign of him anywhere.
L332069 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well?
L331915 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Thanks, Steve.
L331914 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Tell them when they get back to the cars.
