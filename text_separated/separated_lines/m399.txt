L306112 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
L306111 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Your melancholy eyes...
L306110 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
L306109 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You were their leader. They trusted you.
L306108 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
L306107 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And yet you knew what I would o.
L306106 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ No.
L306105 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You didn't even warm them, did you?
L306103 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
L306102 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Louis, I swear I did not.
L306101 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
L306100 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You let them do it.
L306099 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
L306098 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
L306097 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I couldn't prevent it.
L306094 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
L306093 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
L306092 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I can't save her.
L306091 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Not without Claudia. Where is she?
L306090 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Follow me - that way - through my cell -
L306089 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Where is she? Where's Claudia?
L306032 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
L306031 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lestat! You knew Lestat!
L306030 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
L306029 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes... My God...
L306028 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Are these not the answers you came for?
L306027 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
L306026 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And the vampires of the Theatre?
L306022 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ How he must have loved you.
L306021 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's what the one who made me said.
L306020 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
L306019 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We can do that?
L306018 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
L306017 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You said there were none.
L306016 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
L306015 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then I leave too.
L306014 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
L306013 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We want no quarrel with him.
L306012 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
L306011 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then blame the one who made her...
L306010 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
L306009 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But why?
L306008 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ She is.
L306007 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
L306006 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ If you say so. You are innocent.
L306005 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No, my beloved, my child.
L306004 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Your lover.
L306003 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
L306002 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Listen to me.
L306001 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I was waiting for you...
L305970 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Knew? You mean he is...
L305969 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
L305968 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
L305967 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
L305966 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
L305965 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
L305964 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
L305963 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I have not spoken to him...
L305962 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then God does not exist...
L305961 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
L305960 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Perhaps...
L305959 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then there is nothing.
L305958 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
L305957 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ No.
L305956 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You mean we are not children of Satan?
L305955 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ That is a picture, nothing more.
L305954 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
L305953 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Surely you know the one who made you...
L305952 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who made us what we are?
L305951 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Nothing if not vampires...
L305950 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What are we?
L305949 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Ah! You have questions?
L305948 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ So you have the answers...
L305947 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ If there were a leader, I would be the one.
L305946 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Are you the leader of tis group?
L305945 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
L305944 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ But how did you come into existence?
L305943 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We had feared we were the only ones...
L305942 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
L305940 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
L305939 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Your lips, they didn't move.
L305938 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Yes, and very beautiful.
L305937 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Monstrous.
L305804 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
L305803 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Louis, put me in my coffin...
L305802 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Don't Louis --
L305800 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
L305799 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Laudanum!
L305798 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No. Laudanum.
L305797 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
L305796 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ We forgive each other then?
L305795 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
L305794 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
L305791 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
L305790 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
L305789 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Stop pestering me then!
L305788 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
L305787 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What plans?
L305786 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
L305785 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Not you my dear.
L305784 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
L305783 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
L305782 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Is that supposed to frighten me?
L305781 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
L305780 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Does it?
L305779 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
L305734 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
L305733 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
L305731 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
L305730 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Stop her Louis!
L305729 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You made us what we are, didn't you?
L305727 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
L305726 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ It will grow back again!
L305725 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ And if I cut my hair again?
L305724 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What you are? You would be something other than you are?
L305723 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
L305718 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
L305717 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ But you're the fairest by far.
L305716 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I have. Or there would be twice as many.
L305715 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
L305714 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Is this my birthday?
L305713 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I didn't realise.
L305712 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
L305711 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What night? What do you mean?
L305710 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Why always on this night?
L305665 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
L305664 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'm not your daughter.
L305658 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
L305657 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I want some more.
L305652 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
L305651 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ More.
L306066 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
L306065 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L306064 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
L306063 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's only mortal death.
L306062 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ But if she dies...
L306061 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
L306049 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
L306048 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes...
L306047 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
L306045 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
L306044 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
L306043 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
L306042 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
L306000 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You really believe that?
L305999 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He can protect us, Claudia.
L305997 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Let him go, he said. Let him go.
L305996 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ So you felt it too!
L305995 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
L305994 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's not so.
L305993 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
L305992 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Never.
L305991 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
L305990 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Love?
L305989 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
L305988 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
L305987 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Do you think I would let them harm you?
L305986 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
L305985 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What danger?
L305984 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
L305933 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Be still!
L305932 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
L305918 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yes, and very beautiful.
L305917 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ This is monstrous!
L305911 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ And no one knows but us...
L305910 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ This is no performance.
L305906 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
L305905 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ She's no vampire.
L305904 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ How devilishly clever.
L305903 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
L305901 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
L305900 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
L305899 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
L305898 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
L305884 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Come, Claudia...
L305883 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
L305882 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You know her?
L305881 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
L305880 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
L305878 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You are more beautiful than any of them.
L305877 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
L305876 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Claudia, you torture yourself.
L305875 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Or her, or her - or any of them?
L305872 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ But how will I ever know, Louis?
L305871 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
L305870 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You don't remember? Or you never knew.
L305869 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
L305868 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes.
L305867 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
L305865 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes...
L305864 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
L305863 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Still my beautiful child.
L305862 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ How do I look?
L305844 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Not yet.
L305843 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ The ship is sailing wihout us!
L305840 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ It is! Take the back stairwell -
L305839 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It can't be -
L305835 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
L305834 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What was that?
L305831 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
L305830 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
L305829 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
L305828 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And you never cried -
L305827 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
L305825 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I can't. Go away from me.
L305824 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Louis, look at me.
L305823 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
L305822 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
L305821 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
L305819 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
L305818 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
L305817 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ The swamp...
L305816 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Don't mock, Claudia...
L305815 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
L305813 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
L305812 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He's dead, Claudia, dead.
L305810 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
L305809 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
L305776 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He'll never let us go.
L305775 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
L305747 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I took your life. He gave you another one.
L305746 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You both did it?
L305745 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
L305744 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You... fed on me?
L305738 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
L305737 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
L305736 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
L305735 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We're immortal. You've always known that.
L305721 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Why not?
L305720 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Claudia - don't -
L305719 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You want me to be a doll forever?
L305700 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Sit still. It's not finished -
L305699 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Claudia! You did that?
L305698 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
L305697 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Why does he call you that?
L305696 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He jests.
L305695 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
L305694 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
L305693 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
L305692 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ The way I learn everything. By watching you.
L305691 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How did you learn to write, Claudia?
L305650 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What have you done?
L305649 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I want more.
L306145 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You have it...
L306144 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
L306143 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I tried...
L306142 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
L306141 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes. I remember...
L306140 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
L306139 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I have to go now Lestat...
L306138 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
L306137 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
L306136 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
L306135 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And they frighten you?
L306134 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
L306133 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's only a siren...
L306132 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
L306131 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
L306130 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
L306129 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
L306128 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's all past, Lestat.
L306127 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
L306126 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Don't try to speak... it's alright...
L306125 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
L306096 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ CLAUDIA!!!
L306095 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
L306077 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Are you mad????
L306076 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ No... You come back to me Louis...
L305806 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
L305805 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
L305677 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
L305676 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
L305663 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
L305662 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
L305661 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
L305656 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
L305655 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
L305646 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lestat, what do you mean?
L305645 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
L305644 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
L305643 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I didn't want to kill her.
L305642 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
L305641 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lestat!
L305640 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
L305639 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What are you saying?
L305638 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ She's here, your wounded one.
L305637 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
L305636 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
L305635 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
L305634 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ That and more.
L305633 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
L305632 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
L305631 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No...
L305630 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
L305617 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
L305616 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
L305615 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
L305614 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ NO!!!
L305613 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Unless I make her one of us...
L305610 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You finish her - if you feel so much -
L305609 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lestat - finish this -
L305606 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
L305605 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why do you do this Lestat?
L305601 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I know. Let her alone.
L305600 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The girl, Lestat -
L305599 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
L305598 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lestat, she's alive!!!!
L305597 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
L305596 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I don't pretend to know.
L305595 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What do you imagine you are Louis?
L305594 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
L305593 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
L305578 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
L305577 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We belong in hell.
L305576 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
L305575 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Where are we?
L305574 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
L305573 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You fool, what have you done?
L305561 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
L305560 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
L305559 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
L305558 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
L305556 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
L305555 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
L305554 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
L305553 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ As did the one who made me.
L305552 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Paris? You came from Paris?
L305551 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
L305544 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I don't know any hell -
L305543 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
L305535 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
L305534 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I can't.
L305533 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Read her thoughts.
L305532 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But how do you know?
L305531 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
L305528 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
L305527 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Have you ever been caught?
L305521 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
L305520 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
L305519 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
L305518 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Fascination...
L305517 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
L305515 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
L305514 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I know. It gets cold so fast.
L305505 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Do you think so?
L305504 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
L305496 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
L305495 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And if I don't?
L305494 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
L305493 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
L305492 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It can't be...
L305491 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
L305480 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
L305479 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Dear God, what have I done?
L305478 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You have fed. You were made for this...
L305477 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What have I done?
L305475 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Forget the crucifix. Take him.
L305474 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The crucifix -
L305473 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Take him.
L305470 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I want a woman.
L305469 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Come, you're going to feed now.
L305467 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Dying?
L305466 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
L305464 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Sure...
L305463 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You're sure?
L305458 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes...
L305457 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Did I hear a yes?
L305453 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
L305452 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
L305451 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You really want to be with them?
L305450 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
L305449 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But why do you want me?
L305448 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
L305447 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I can't go through with it, I tell you.
L305446 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
L305445 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
L305444 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
L305443 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
L305442 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You've just done it -
L305441 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I can't do it.
L305440 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Let's call that a start.
L305437 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Call him.
L305436 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How do you mean, start?
L305435 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
L305430 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I want it!
L305429 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Vampires. We thrive on blood.
L305428 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Give it to me!!!
L305427 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
L305426 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ NO!!!!!
L305425 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
L305424 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Diane!!!!
L305419 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
L305418 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L305415 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why should I be?
L305414 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You're not afraid of anything, are you?
L305413 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
L305412 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
L305405 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes...
L305404 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You want death? Is it death you want?
L305403 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then my luck would have changed.
L305402 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ They would have killed you -
L306161 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
L306160 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ No...
L306159 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
L306157 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
L306156 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
L306153 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
L306152 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's over, I'm telling you...
L306151 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
L306150 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But it has. There is no more to tell.
L306149 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ No... it can't end like that...
L306124 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
L306123 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Lestat escaped the fire!
L305858 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
L305857 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
L305856 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
L305855 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You found nothing?
L305847 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
L305846 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Did he die in the fire?
L305752 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
L305751 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ And did you lose her? Did she go?
L305750 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How could I not? She had to know.
L305749 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ But why did you tell her?
L305672 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
L305671 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ He did it to make you stay with him!
L305670 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Shall we go on?
L305582 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
L305581 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You loved your wife, surely.
L305580 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Can a vampire feel love?
L305579 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You loved Yvette...
L305489 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
L305488 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ What about coffins?
L305487 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
L305486 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ The story about stakes through the heart?
L305485 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
L305484 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You can't look at them...
L305483 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, that rumour about crosses?
L305482 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You said the slave had a crucifix...
L305391 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
L305390 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Yes.
L305389 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
L305388 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You're not lying to me, are you?
L305387 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
L305386 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
L305385 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ How did you do that?
L305381 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
L305380 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
L305379 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
L305378 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
L305377 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
L305376 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
L305374 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Perhaps lucky for both of us.
L305373 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Well, what a lucky break for me.
L305372 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
L305371 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
L305370 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm a vampire.
L305369 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
L305368 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's just a room...
L305367 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
L305366 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You followed me here, didn't you?
L305365 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
L305364 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
L305363 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
L305362 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
L306059 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes!
L306058 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
L306057 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ My daughter...
L306056 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And the child who did die?
L306055 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ A child who can't die...
L306054 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
L306053 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes.
L306052 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And you know what you ask for?
L306051 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes...
L306050 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You promise to care for her then?
L306040 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
L306039 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
