L454633 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ "chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
L454632 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
L454631 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ So you can't talk to me?
L454630 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
L454629 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah but what are you doing?
L454628 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Hello, Karen. I'm just working.

L454561 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Ok. Thank you.
L454560 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
L454557 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
L454556 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
L454555 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ That's it.
L454554 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
L454553 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
L454552 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
L454551 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ This is "Fly With Us?"
L454550 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
L454549 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ And what was this?
L454548 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ...yes I'm still on hold...
L455348 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ -- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.

L455346 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
L455345 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Tell me why.
L455344 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I just want to know where she's staying.

L455337 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You're so scared.
L455336 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
L455335 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
L455334 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
L455333 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Hey. What are you doing?

L454988 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
L454987 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?

L455204 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What?
L455203 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Did you pick it up from the street?
L455202 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Well, it's fine. Thank you.
L455201 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Your portable reed organ....the piano.
L455199 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.

L455197 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ There's a better place for us to eat.
L455196 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Ok.
L455195 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I have a better idea of where we can go.
L455194 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Nothing.
L455193 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ What did he want?
L455192 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Nothing.
L455191 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ What happened?
L455190 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Yes.
L455189 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Is everything ok?
L455148 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
L455147 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
L455146 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
L455145 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ No I didn't say that.
L455144 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ I'm sorry. I thought you said --
L455143 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ....No....
L455142 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ So that was your pudding?
L455141 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ....yeah....
L455140 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
L455139 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
L455138 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Yeah, no, I see --
L455137 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ You see?
L455136 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Yeah.
L455135 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
L455134 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Yeah.
L455133 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ -- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
L455132 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ You were talking about the promotion --
L455131 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
L455130 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Yeah?
L455129 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
L455128 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Yeah.

L455104 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ What's the problem?
L455103 +++$+++ u2520 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LATISHA +++$+++ Uch. Shut up, Dean.
L455102 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ ...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
L455082 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I'm only paying two of you guys.
