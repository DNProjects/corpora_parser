L648532 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
L648531 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648530 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ No.  But once I heard...
L648529 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did you?
L648528 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ A ghost?
L648527 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I started seeing things.
L648526 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L648525 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
L648524 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ So much.
L648523 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I miss you.
L648522 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
L648521 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Are you mad at me?
L648520 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I know he does.
L648519 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He loves you very much.  He just--
L648518 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
L648517 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not true.
L648516 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
L648515 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, he wouldn't.
L648514 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Besides, Dad would have freaked.
L648512 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why?
L648511 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
L648510 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That was very good.
L647966 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
L647965 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course you will.
L647964 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'll come back all the time.
L647963 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know that.
L647962 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ It's only two hours away.
L647961 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes?
L647960 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Hey.
L647959 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do you have a scarf?
L648459 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
L648458 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ That can't feel good.
L648457 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
L648456 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What?
L648452 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
L648451 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You were in an accident?
L648450 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
L648449 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Have you been hurt?
L648448 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
L648447 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What do you think?  Guess.
L648446 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648445 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you?
L648444 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She said, "You know."  That I know.
L648442 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
L648441 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You're saying you willed these events to happen?
L648440 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
L648439 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You think you influenced her?
L648438 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Isn't there something called group hysteria?
L648437 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Your friend saw them.
L648436 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes, but...
L648435 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
L648434 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Well, that's what we're here for.
L648433 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's happening to me?
L648361 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
L648360 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How?
L648359 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Nope.
L648358 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are you humoring me?
L648357 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
L648356 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You think that'll help?
L648355 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Try to communicate with her somehow.
L648354 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648352 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What do you think I should do?
L648351 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Fine.
L648350 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
L648349 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you have any idea who she is?
L648348 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Pretty.  She's a blond.
L648347 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What does she look like?
L648346 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
L648345 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ How do you know it's a she?
L648344 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
L648342 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Mm-hmm.
L648341 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ These are good.
L648336 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're joking.
L648335 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Fireball?
L648334 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
L648333 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Why is he worried?
L648332 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648331 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you really think so?
L648330 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
L648329 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Your husband?
L648328 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Because he was worried about me.
L648327 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Then why did you?
L648326 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I didn't want to come.
L648325 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
L648324 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Who's idea was it?
L648582 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ The wives.
L648581 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who's that?
L648580 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
L648579 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
L648578 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Toward the end.  You remember?
L648577 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ At the party.
L648576 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
L648575 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
L648574 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
L648573 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
L648572 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Uh-huh.  What can be?
L648571 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ I know how hard it can be sometimes.
L648570 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L648569 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
L648568 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Almost.
L648567 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
L648566 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
L648565 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ How're you holding up?
L648538 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
L648537 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I am.
L648536 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Of course.  You must be so proud.
L648428 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ I didn't kill my wife.
L648427 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Give me that shit.  Your wife.
L648426 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ Who?
L648194 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ I have to go.
L648193 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh-kay...
L648192 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ I don't know.
L648191 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When...when will she be back?
L648190 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ She isn't here.
L648189 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well maybe your wife...
L648188 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ This really isn't a good time.
L648187 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
L648186 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
L648185 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...
L648184 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ Yes?
L648484 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
L648483 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  No, I don't.
L648482 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You must think I'm pathetic.
L648481 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
L648480 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...sure.
L648479 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
L648478 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648477 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Love.
L648475 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
L648474 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
L648473 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ No.
L648470 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
L648469 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Thank you.
L648468 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Your house is so beautiful.
L648467 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Very much.
L648466 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Would you like some iced tea?
L648465 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Right.  I'm sorry.
L648464 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ And then you weren't there.
L648463 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
L648462 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You do?
L648461 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I wanted to apologize.
L648043 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wait!  Don't go...
L648042 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
L648041 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
L648040 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ This fence...it's so...
L648039 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
L648038 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I've never even met you.
L648037 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not...It's not like that.
L648036 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
L648035 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tell me.  I can help you.
L648034 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
L648033 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tell me.  Please.
L648032 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I can't, no, no, I can't...
L648031 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?  What are you afraid of?
L648030 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
L648029 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who?  Your husband?
L648028 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
L648027 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I'm not...
L648026 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hello?
L648025 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Is everything alright?
L648024 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I've seen you.  From the window.
L648023 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...yes.
L648022 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You're the flower lady.
L648021 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
L648020 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Who are you?
L648659 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
L648658 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What was her major?
L648657 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course.
L648656 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
L648655 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I should be going anyway.
L648654 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ They're calling me in to work.
L648651 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You must have been very proud.
L648650 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
L648648 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
L648647 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648646 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Why are you here?
L648644 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
L648643 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She never mentioned her father.
L648642 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
L648641 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
L648640 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ You look a little old for a student.
L648639 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's fine.
L648638 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
L648635 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ She never mentioned you.
L648634 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Claire.
L648633 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ What's your name?
L648630 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Please leave me alone.
L648629 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, I don't.
L648628 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ You know where she is?
L648627 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
L648626 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Yeah.
L648625 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mrs. Frank?
L648305 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
L648304 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ She got it.  Turned it down.
L648302 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
L648301 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's making this up.
L648300 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
L648299 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do we have to?
L648298 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
L648297 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Stop.
L648296 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You should have heard her play.
L648293 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh God...
L648292 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
L648291 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We were suite mates.
L648290 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I came in from my room...
L648289 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He was so pissed.
L648288 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ ...just so she could cut them off.
L648287 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I didn't sleep with him.
L648286 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Anyway, Claire slept with him...
L648285 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He looked like one of the Monkees.
L648282 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We know each other.
L648281 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ This is...
L648280 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.
L648805 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
L648804 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know...
L648803 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
L648802 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
L648801 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I guess not.
L648800 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
L648799 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody he was lying.
L648798 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Did he say that?
L648797 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
L648770 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What is it?
L648769 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
L648768 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Like what?
L648767 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
L648766 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
L648765 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
L648764 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I can't believe this is happening.
L648763 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I know.
L648762 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, she tried to kill him.
L648750 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
L648749 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
L648748 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
L648747 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ If she was dangerous before--
L648746 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648745 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L648744 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
L648743 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648742 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I'm a terrible friend.
L648741 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ All of us.
L648740 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
L648739 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
L648738 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
L648737 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
L648736 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
L648735 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Relieved?
L648734 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
L648733 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why?
L648732 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
L648731 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
L648730 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Adamant?
L648729 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I was down in Adamant...
L648728 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh God...you knew.
L648564 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
L648563 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.
L648562 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Please.
L648561 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ But Claire--
L648560 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
L648559 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
L648558 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hartford?
L648557 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
L648556 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did I?
L648555 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Something was there.  You saw it.
L648554 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
L648553 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Then what was it?
L648552 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
L648551 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What?
L648550 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, she's alive.
L648549 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Does Norman know?
L648548 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
L648547 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's alright.
L648546 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
L648545 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think so
L648544 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Are you okay?
L648389 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, wait.
L648388 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I have to go.
L648383 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
L648382 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Mef?  What's Mef?
L648381 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ M-E...
L648380 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh...
L648375 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Shhh.
L648374 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing's happening.
L648371 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648370 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
L648369 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ This.
L648368 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The planchette?
L648367 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Place your fingers on the planchette.
L648364 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
L648363 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Sit down here.
L648218 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
L648217 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.  I'm losing it.
L648215 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I don't...
L648214 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the window.  Norman's at work.
L648213 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What?
L648212 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Someone's there.
L648209 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Please.  That's all I need.
L648208 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
L648207 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...no...no...no...
L648206 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Telling you...
L648205 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, no...
L648204 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Seance.
L648203 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648202 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Know what I think?
L648199 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
L648198 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You think he killed her?
L648101 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You got it.
L648100 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
L648099 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Absolutely.
L648098 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
L648097 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's niiice.
L648096 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Yep.
L648095 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh my god.  You bought it.
L648094 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
L648093 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Thanks, but I'm fine.
L648092 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
L648091 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're discussing me with your psychic?
L648090 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
L648089 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody--
L648088 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Kambucha mushroom tea...
L648087 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What is it?
L648086 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
L648085 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
L648084 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Well good.  So you're human.
L648083 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay, I'm a little tender.
L648082 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
L648081 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why does everyone find that so surprising?
L648080 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You are?
L648079 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Good.  I'm good.
L648078 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ How you holding up?
L648842 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ MADISON!
L648841 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648840 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mauduh...
L648839 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Shhhh.
L648838 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mmmuh...
L648821 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
L648820 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L648819 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
L648818 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
L648817 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
L648816 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
L648811 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
L648810 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I know.
L648809 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You don't have to do that.
L648808 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm cooking you dinner.
L648807 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.
L648806 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What's that for?
L648795 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
L648794 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Don't think so.
L648793 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do you know it?
L648792 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Huh.
L648791 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
L648790 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648789 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Adamant.
L648788 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
L648787 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Look for antiques...
L648786 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
L648785 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The leaves...
L648781 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648780 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
L648779 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How can you be sure?
L648778 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She can't be here without me.
L648777 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648776 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's gone.
L648775 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
L648774 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's alright.
L648773 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We have to get out of here.
L648723 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
L648722 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We don't know that for sure.
L648721 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She did it.
L648718 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How did she know where it was?
L648717 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
L648711 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Get out of my way.
L648710 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648709 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You should have tried harder.
L648708 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I tried to break it off!
L648707 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm not going to listen to this.
L648706 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
L648705 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Stop...
L648704 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
L648703 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Leave her out of this!
L648702 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ To Caitlin!!
L648701 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who?
L648700 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
L648699 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
L648698 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I never asked you to quit!
L648697 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
L648696 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, please don't...
L648693 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
L648692 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's not what I'm sayi--
L648691 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ So you fucked a student?!
L648690 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It was last year.  We were having troubles.
L648689 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
L648688 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh God...
L648687 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
L648686 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire--
L648685 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I was there.
L648684 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648683 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ "You know..."
L648681 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ STOP IT!
L648680 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Your wife...
L648679 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who?
L648678 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think she's starting to suspect something.
L648677 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
L648676 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't like this, this...
L648675 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Since when?
L648674 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's too rough.
L648673 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L648672 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ow!
L648669 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wouldn't go that far.
L648668 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I take it your not mad at me.
L648619 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ STOP IT!
L648618 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's Madison Fra--
L648617 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...Please stop...
L648616 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...I'm positive this time...
L648615 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Stop...
L648614 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
L648613 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  The ghost.
L648612 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ The...
L648611 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
L648610 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
L648609 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not personally.
L648608 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I may have seen her on campus.
L648596 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's wrong with me?
L648595 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
L648594 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But I don't remember.
L648593 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
L648592 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
L648591 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
L648590 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the living room...
L648589 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
L648588 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I...
L648587 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You dropped a glass.
L648586 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
L648585 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You don't remember?
L648500 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You told me that I was...
L648499 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We walked all night...
L648498 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I felt you...looking through me...
L648497 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
L648496 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
L648495 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know I am.
L648494 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are you glad?  I'm glad.
L648493 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648491 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Call ya later.
L648490 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yep.
L648489 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Do I have everything?
L648488 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Really big bed.
L648487 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
L648486 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
L648430 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Then where is she?
L648429 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L648420 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, please...
L648419 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
L648418 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I will NOT.
L648417 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
L648414 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
L648413 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sweetheart--
L648412 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
L648411 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ But then you've been so much better...
L648410 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The accident...?
L648409 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
L648408 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Sabotage?
L648407 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
L648406 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What are you...?  No.
L648405 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
L648404 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648402 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
L648401 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How did you--
L648400 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
L648399 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who did?
L648398 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We had a seance.
L648397 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How do you know this?
L648396 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
L648395 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ This is the Feur thing?
L648394 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
L648393 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What are you doing out here?
L648323 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
L648322 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Are you lonely?
L648321 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
L648320 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I never said...
L648319 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
L648318 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
L648315 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What can it hurt to talk to someone?
L648314 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman...
L648313 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Harvey says he's amazing.
L648312 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't need a shrink.
L648272 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well, that's a relief.
L648271 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ There we go.
L648270 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We're going to be fine.
L648269 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
L648268 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're not at the center.
L648267 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Five minutes?
L648266 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
L648265 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L648264 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
L648263 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...like it never even happened...
L648262 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...Don't get all...
L648261 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ When you do this, I swear...
L648259 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
L648258 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tonight?
L648257 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
L648256 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh.
L648255 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
L648254 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When?
L648253 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
L648252 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Dressed?
L648251 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
L648250 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
L648249 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
L648248 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe.  Point is...not me.
L648247 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
L648246 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I didn't do that.
L648245 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What am I looking at?
L648244 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ See?
L648243 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
L648242 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
L648241 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Where is she then?
L648236 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's a ghost.
L648235 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
L648234 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
L648233 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ A flare?
L648232 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's a flare.
L648231 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Look!  In the window.
L648230 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Our house.
L648229 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
L648228 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
L648227 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
L648226 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648225 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He killed her.
L648223 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Shhhh.
L648222 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What's going on, Claire?
L648221 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Get down!  He'll see.
L648178 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Huh.
L648177 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
L648176 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did you call about the Feurs?
L648175 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sorry.  You understand.
L648172 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
L648171 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You didn't?
L648170 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?  No.  No.
L648169 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you tell her?
L648168 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
L648167 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
L648166 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm so sorry.
L648165 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...for my father."
L648164 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's...
L648163 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
L648162 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh, no...
L648161 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
L648160 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well, that's nice.
L648159 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
L648158 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.
L648157 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
L648156 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're kidding.
L648155 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
L648154 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what that does to me.
L648153 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
L648152 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yep.
L648151 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You are so brilliant.
L648150 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I think so.  Maybe.
L648149 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Really?
L648148 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Think I may have cracked it.
L648147 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
L648146 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
L648141 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.  Just...whispering.
L648140 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What kind of whispering?
L648139 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
L648138 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Of course.
L648137 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
L648136 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you call the police?
L648135 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the house.  I was scared.
L648134 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?  Some noises where?
L648133 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
L648132 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L648113 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
L648112 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire?
L648110 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, no.  It's fine.
L648109 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Unless you need me to come home...
L648108 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh.
L648107 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
L648106 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hi.
L648075 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Is it gone?
L648074 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
L648071 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hurry...
L648070 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Mmnph.
L648069 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, you have to look at this!
L648066 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Promise?
L648065 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
L648064 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I just wish you could have heard her.
L648063 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's what I've been working for.
L648062 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.
L648061 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
L648060 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'd never be able to live with mysel--
L648059 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648058 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But what if something happens?
L648057 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
L648056 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not what I'm sug--
L648055 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
L648054 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To make sure she's all right.
L648053 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Why?
L648052 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
L648051 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Remember how we were?
L648050 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
L648049 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
L648048 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ More or less.
L648047 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did she say that?
L648046 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of him I think.
L648045 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Of what?
L648014 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'll be there.
L648013 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ After that.
L648012 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
L648011 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L648010 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Maybe we should just...
L648009 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mmm.
L648008 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And we moved out here for the quiet.
L648004 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Shhh.
L648003 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you...
L648002 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yup.
L648001 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Wanna fool around?
L648000 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nope.
L647999 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Tired?
L647998 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.
L647997 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's just us now.
L647996 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We did.
L647995 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
L647994 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
L647993 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You are...
L647992 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
L647991 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L647990 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not the focus.
L647989 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's just she's been the focus for a while.
L647988 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I am, really.
L647987 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's okay if you're not.
L647986 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Fine.
L647985 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How are you?
L647984 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
L647983 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ If you have to work...
L647982 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Nice.  Almost done.
L647981 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
L647980 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How is it?
L647979 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
L647978 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Whatcha reading?
L647957 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Three o'clock.
L647956 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire?
L647954 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yep.
L647953 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's today?

L647949 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Don't.
L647948 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
L647947 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman Spencer.
L647946 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ When's she out of here?
L647944 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
L647943 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's awake.
L647942 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
L647941 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's their name?
L647940 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Three weeks.
L647939 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think three...
