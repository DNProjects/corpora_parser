L151597 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jennifer gave her a make-over.
L151596 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
L151585 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Can we get some service here?
L151584 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Waiter! She needs more water.
L151192 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
L151191 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
L151190 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
L151189 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
L151188 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
L151187 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
L151186 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
L151185 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
L151613 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Never felt better.
L151612 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
L151611 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I've been working out.
L151610 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Wow your body's really hot.
L151609 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Your lips look delicious.
L151608 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What?
L151606 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Yeah but they looked cool...
L151605 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
L151604 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
L151603 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No.
L151602 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
L151601 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
L151600 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I've changed a lot lately.
L151599 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
L151577 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
L151576 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
L151575 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
L151573 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
L151572 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
L151571 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
L151471 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
L151470 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Does she have PMS?
L151469 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
L151468 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I get crazy dreams and I black out.
L151467 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
L151466 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
L151465 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ How have you been feeling?
L151464 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Nearly four.
L151463 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
L151264 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's not just in my head.
L151263 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
L151262 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What else is there?
L151261 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
L151260 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
L151259 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
L151258 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Good. Except for PMS.
L151257 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ How's the rest of your health?
L151255 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, it was another woman.
L151254 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ A dog at Victoria's Secret?
L151253 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh, on my wrist.
L151252 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I mean where on your body?
L151251 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ There was a sale.
L151250 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ At Victoria's Secret.
L151249 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
L151643 +++$+++ u4735 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
L151642 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
L151641 +++$+++ u4735 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
L151640 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What does that have to do with me?
L151639 +++$+++ u4735 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
L151638 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Mom!
L151637 +++$+++ u4735 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No it's mom.
L151636 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Jennifer?
L152038 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Sure. See ya.
L152037 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
L152036 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
L152035 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
L152034 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida? You okay?
L152033 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Hello?
L151977 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
L151976 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
L151975 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I wish I only had your problems.
L151974 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
L151973 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I thought you and George were getting married.
L151972 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
L151971 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Did I kill a guy named Benito?
L151970 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ About Benito.
L151969 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ About Mark? Carlton?
L151968 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I think George knows.
L151967 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
L151966 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No. I won't let you do that.
L151965 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
L151964 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I guess you'll find out.
L151963 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
L151962 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
L151961 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
L151960 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
L151959 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
L151958 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
L151957 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm cleaning my stove.
L151939 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I already have.
L151938 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Fall in love.
L151937 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ So what do I do?
L151936 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What choice do we have?
L151935 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
L151934 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
L151933 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Guess she never found true love.
L151932 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
L151931 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
L151930 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ "The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
L151929 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
L151928 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
L151926 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Check out what I found.
L151925 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ "Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
L151895 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
L151894 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
L151893 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
L151892 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Peter keeps asking me out.
L151891 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
L151868 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
L151867 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're such a good friend.
L151866 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
L151865 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
L151864 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Does that mean this whole thing is over?
L151863 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I just got my period.
L151856 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
L151855 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Peter knows something.
L151809 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hide him.
L151808 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What the fuck are we going to do?
L151804 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Tell them you'll meet them outside.
L151803 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
L151802 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Ignore it.
L151801 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No.
L151800 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You expecting someone?
L151799 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You should have seen it erect.
L151798 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
L151791 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
L151790 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
L151789 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
L151788 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I could smell another woman on him.
L151787 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Why the fuck would you do that?
L151786 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
L151785 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
L151784 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
L151783 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
L151782 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
L151781 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
L151780 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What? Why'd you do that?
L151779 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
L151778 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Why not? There's been a murder.
L151777 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ DON'T call the police.
L151776 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
L151775 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What happened to his tooth?
L151768 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah, I guess. Mark?
L151767 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He's been here all night?
L151766 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
L151765 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Did you get rid of Mark?
L151764 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Holy shit, I don't know.
L151744 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
L151743 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay, I gotta go.
L151742 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Get rid of him!
L151738 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
L151737 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
L151736 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And he was missing an arm.
L151735 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh no.
L151734 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, Carlton's dead.
L151733 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Shit, I guess I missed work.
L151732 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Tuesday. Are you okay?
L151731 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I've been here. What day is it?
L151730 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
L151729 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Hello?
L151670 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
L151669 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
L151668 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I haven't gotten it yet.
L151667 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
L151666 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
L151665 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
L151664 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
L151663 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
L151662 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
L151661 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And what makes you think you killed a man?
L151660 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I put it down the garbage disposal.
L151659 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So where's this infamous arm now?
L151634 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
L151633 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
L151632 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
L151631 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
L151630 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
L151628 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ There is a man's arm in my bed.
L151627 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
L151595 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
L151594 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
L151593 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
L151592 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No they're not.
L151591 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
L151590 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No you don't, believe me.
L151589 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
L151588 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
L151587 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
L151581 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I still thought it was a purse.
L151580 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
L151579 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It is so hot in here.
L151578 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Charming Carlton.
L151570 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
L151569 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I think he called you beautiful.
L151568 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What did he say?
L151566 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're just saying that.
L151565 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
L151564 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
L151559 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
L151558 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay. I guess so.
L151557 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
L151555 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
L151554 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
L151553 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
L151552 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
L151551 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How'd it go with the cop?
L151550 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I looked like an Italian man!
L151549 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
L151548 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
L151527 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
L151526 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What the hell is the tampon test?
L151525 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Give him the tampon test.
L151524 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
L151523 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
L151522 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
L151436 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
L151435 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
L151434 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
L151433 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
L151432 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
L151420 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
L151419 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I wonder if he's married.
L151418 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Rule one: always wear make-up.
L151417 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
L151416 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
L151415 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
L151414 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Are those Mark's?
L151413 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My vision got worse again.
L151412 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
L151411 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ And my bra finally fits again.
L151410 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ At least your PMS is over.
L151409 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
L151408 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And then?
L151407 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
L151406 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What? Why the hell did he do that?
L151405 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
L151404 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
L151403 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
L151402 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
L151401 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
L151400 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
L151399 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. I don't think so.
L151398 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No, did you fuck him?
L151397 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Did I kill him? Of course not!
L151396 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So did you do it?
L151395 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
L151394 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Why would they exaggerate?
L151393 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I'm sure they were exaggerating.
L151392 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ And he was ripped limb from limb?
L151391 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
L151390 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
L151322 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
L151321 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hey, did you get contacts?
L151320 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
L151319 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Holy shit, I'm a freak.
L151318 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
L151317 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
L151316 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Where?
L151314 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
L151313 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
L151312 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
L151311 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Maybe they have to pee.
L151310 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
L151309 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
L151308 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
L151307 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
L151248 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
L151247 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ George bit you?
L151246 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
L151245 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think she broke the skin.
L151244 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
L151243 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And she got the medium.
L151242 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
L151236 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, grab that red one.
L151235 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Where are all the mediums?
L151230 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
L151229 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know.
L151228 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
L151227 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
L151226 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
L151207 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
L151206 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Or if there's a full moon.
L151201 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
L151200 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
L151199 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Can't you get contacts?
L151198 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Only to see.
L151197 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Do you really need these?
L151196 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're just saying that.
L151195 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
L151184 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'd kill for just a little bloated.
L151183 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I get a little bloated sometimes.
L151182 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
L151181 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
L151180 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
L151179 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe he's just shy.
L151178 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He hasn't said one word to me.
L151168 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ People notice you Frida.
L151167 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
L151164 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So don't look in his eyes.
L151163 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
L151162 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
L151161 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He's a very talented musician.
L151160 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
L151159 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My shrink says he's not so bad.
L151158 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Anything's better than Mark.
L151157 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Translation: a total geek.
L151156 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
L151155 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
L151154 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
L151153 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
L151358 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
L151357 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ So pee? Here?
L151356 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Uh huh. So pee.
L151355 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
L151354 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
L151353 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Yes I do have to pee!
L151352 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You don't have to pee.
L151351 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Knock what off?
L151350 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh come on. Knock it off.
L151349 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
L151348 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My apartment's just such a mess.
L151347 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I didn't have to pee then.
L151346 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You should have gone at the restaurant.
L151345 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I really gotta pee.
L151344 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What?
L151342 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
L151341 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ They say sex is great for cramps.
L151340 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
L151339 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
L151338 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm really tired.
L151337 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Hey, how about a little nightcap?
L151336 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
L151334 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ That's great. Highly original.
L151333 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Well, whattdaya think?
L151332 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
L151328 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
L151327 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm not really hungry after all.
L151326 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
L151324 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Starving.
L151323 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ You hungry?
L151276 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
L151275 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're kidding, really?
L151274 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
L151273 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I do development for TV movies.
L151272 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ So you're Grant's secretary?
L151271 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I know.
L151762 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Take your shower.
L151761 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Wow.
L151760 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah?
L151759 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Mark.
L151756 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
L151755 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My bra is my biggest supporter.
L151754 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
L151753 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
L151752 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
L151751 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
L151750 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
L151749 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ So pay them back and apologize.
L151748 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
L151747 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
L151746 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ This really isn't a good time.
L151745 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It's a matter of life and death.
L151741 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's Mark.
L151740 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
L151480 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
L151479 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Where'd you get the bike?
L151306 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm working on it...
L151305 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
L151304 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
L151303 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah right... You better go.
L151302 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Frida, you know you're it for me.
L151301 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
L151300 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
L151298 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I can't help it, it smells so good.
L151297 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
L151296 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, I'm sorry!
L151295 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Look what you did!
L151293 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No.
L151292 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
L151291 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You never say that.
L151290 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You look different. I mean you look good.
L151288 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Since when do you care?
L151287 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What, you got a date or somethin'?
L151874 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Very well then. Is that all?
L151873 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
L151872 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ No?
L151871 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No.
L151870 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
L151869 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
L151462 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
L151461 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think we should do something with strong female characters...
L151460 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Yes, that's what we're looking for.
L151459 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
L151440 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ A little.
L151439 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Did you change your hair?
L151438 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
L151219 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Your desk.
L151218 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Coffee and...
L151217 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ On your desk.
L151216 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Script coverage?
L151215 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ On your desk.
L151214 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ The Nielson's?
L152042 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks.
L152041 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Here's a towel.
L152030 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay.
L152029 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm going to take a shower.
L152026 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know. The important thing is that it stop.
L152025 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
L152024 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
L152023 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What about... those guys... I might have...
L152022 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
L152021 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Worse than this?
L152020 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
L152019 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
L152018 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't kill me.
L152015 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
L152014 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
L152013 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
L152012 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Be careful!
L152010 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
L152009 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
L152008 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
L152007 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ How do you know?
L152006 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't think you'll hurt me.
L152005 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Peter I love you too but...
L152004 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
L152003 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Go away. I might hurt you.
L151992 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
L151991 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
L151990 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
L151989 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
L151988 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
L151987 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You at least owe me the truth.
L151986 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
L151985 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
L151984 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What? Is there someone else?
L151983 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
L151982 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
L151981 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Hello?
L151944 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
L151943 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
L151942 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
L151941 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ They do? Oh no...
L151940 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Your breasts feel larger.
L151913 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
L151912 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know, I've never seen your cat.
L151911 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
L151910 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's with the squirt guns?
L151909 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I love you too.
L151908 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You didn't say it.
L151907 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
L151906 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is that how you feel?
L151905 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
L151904 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is it that funny?
L151902 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, my bite's a lot worse.
L151901 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
L151900 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ This is a lot worse than "Betty."
L151899 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
L151889 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Interesting possibility.
L151888 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
L151887 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, but thanks for the warning.
L151886 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
L151885 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L151884 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Except Mark of course.
L151883 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
L151882 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
L151881 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
L151880 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What happened?
L151879 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What happened?
L151878 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, I got it. It's okay.
L151877 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
L151876 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
L151875 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
L151851 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
L151850 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, why?
L151848 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
L151847 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
L151845 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
L151844 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
L151824 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
L151823 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You had a date with Carlton?
L151807 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
L151806 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
L151805 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Uh.... hi!
L151658 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A man killed in Central Park.
L151657 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Everything okay?
L151653 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
L151652 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
L151651 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. Nope, nothing in it.
L151650 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Was there anything in that washer?
L151648 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
L151647 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No. I was doing my laundry.
L151646 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
L151546 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
L151545 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
L151544 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
L151541 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My period? No.
L151540 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
L151539 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L151538 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay, you busted me.
L151537 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
L151534 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
L151533 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What are they for?
L151532 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
L151531 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What are those?
L151521 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Goodnight.
L151520 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Goodnight.
L151519 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah. Maybe.
L151518 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
L151517 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I really gotta get going.
L151516 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
L151515 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
L151514 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
L151513 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Briefs.
L151512 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ How about you? Briefs or boxers?
L151510 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
L151509 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ A lot of people don't wear underwear.
L151508 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
L151507 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Like what?
L151506 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
L151505 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
L151504 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
L151503 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
L151502 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
L151501 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, by wolves?
L151500 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
L151499 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L151498 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, she died when I was twelve.
L151497 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Used to? Did it stop finally?
L151496 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ My mom used to get PMS too.
L151495 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can forgive you a bestseller.
L151494 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's stupid.
L151493 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No really, I love knowing what people read.
L151492 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh, it's nothing.
L151491 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So what book did you buy?
L151490 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
L151489 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
L151488 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
L151487 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
L151486 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You wanna get some coffee?
L151485 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There's a lot of that going around.
L151484 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
L151483 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
L151477 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
L151476 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
L151475 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Intriguing?
L151474 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
L151473 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Are you following me?
L151472 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You busted me.
L151383 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
L151382 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
L151377 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
L151376 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ When's the last time you saw him?
L151680 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
L151679 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
L151678 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
L151677 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ We didn't have sex.
L151676 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
L151675 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
L151674 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
L151673 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I ate a guy last night.
L151672 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
L151671 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I'm a werewolf.
L151225 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ Oh, I see... interesting theory.
L151224 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
L151840 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Packages of money.
L151839 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
L151832 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How big?
L151831 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, I have a cat.
L151830 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You got a dog?
L151829 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
L151826 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What makes you think I was the last one?
L151825 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
L151822 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
L151821 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You heard about Carlton Fraser?
L151388 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, take it.
L151387 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ We can get a warrant if you like.
L151379 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, I said it was our first date.
L151378 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
L151375 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
L151374 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, it was our first date.
L151373 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
L151372 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes... I... we had dinner.
L151366 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, what happened?
L151365 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
L151688 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
L151687 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You can't believe this bullshit.
L151686 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Take some allergy medicine.
L151685 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
L151684 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
L151683 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
L151682 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
L151681 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
L151626 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Tell her I'm eating.
L151625 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's for you. Frida.
L151617 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
L151616 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
L151615 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
L151563 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
L151562 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
L151561 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's just so... pathetic.
L151560 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
L151205 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
L151204 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
L151171 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
L151170 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
L151838 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's been running money for the Mafia.
L151837 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ See he was cheating from the get go.
L151817 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
L151816 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why would you want to be a cop?
L151815 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
L151386 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We can just take this pillowcase.
L151385 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You want her sheets?
L151381 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We're just trying to figure out what happened.
L151380 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How the hell is that your business?
L151371 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
L151370 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
L152002 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
L152001 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What kind of animal?
L152000 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
L151999 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did we get those DNA tests back?
L151998 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And that was 28 days ago today.
L151997 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
L151996 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
L151995 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What makes her think that?
L151994 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
L151924 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
L151923 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
L151922 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
L151921 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L151920 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And fifth, you're dating her.
L151919 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
L151918 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
L151917 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
L151916 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You think mafia hit?
L151860 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Like a vampire or some shit?
L151859 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
L151858 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
L151857 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
L151842 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
L151841 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
L151828 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ This one walk you home too?
L151827 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He means the last that we know of.
L151797 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
L151796 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
L151795 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
L151794 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
L151793 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The park dude was missing an arm.
L151792 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
L151726 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
L151725 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
L151724 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
L151723 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
L151722 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
L151721 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
L151720 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We only live a few blocks apart.
L151719 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
L151697 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And he was missing an arm.
L151696 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
L151455 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And you think I'm sick?
L151454 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L151453 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
L151452 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
L151451 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Madonna's in Penthouse?
L151450 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
L151449 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
L151448 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
L151447 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
L151446 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hey, there was a lot of blood.
L151445 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I told you she was innocent.
L151444 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
L151427 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
L151426 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
L151425 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
L151424 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
L151423 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
L151422 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
L151421 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
L151368 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
L151367 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He was found a few blocks away.
L151281 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
L151280 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're some catch Lloyd.
