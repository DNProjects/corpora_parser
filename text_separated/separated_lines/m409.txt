L329191 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ What is it?
L329190 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Oh, my God.
L329179 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ One way to find out.
L329178 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Do you think it goes all the way across?
L329079 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ This is how you play God.
L329078 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ This is how you make dinosaurs?
L329015 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Quiet!
L329014 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Eric!
L328983 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
L328982 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
L328980 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
L328979 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
L328931 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
L328930 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ ERRR-IIIC!
L329293 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I would completely support that.
L329292 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
L329272 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
L329271 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You mean it?
L329270 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We should try fishing again.
L329216 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
L329215 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He could have died.
L329214 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
L329213 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
L329212 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ You couldn't have made that jump.
L329211 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
L329197 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
L329196 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
L329184 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We're not going anywhere, I promise.
L329183 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
L329163 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
L329162 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
L329160 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
L329159 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ What?...WHAT!?
L329157 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Think.
L329156 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't remember
L329155 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ When did you have it last?
L329154 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know. I don't have it with me.
L329134 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
L329133 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That one time was just the bumper.
L329132 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
L329131 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
L329130 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Well what?
L329124 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
L329123 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
L329092 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We have to help him.
L329091 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's not safe.
L329090 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He's this way.
L329089 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Udesky.
L329074 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Eric!
L329073 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Eric! Are you here?
L329056 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
L329055 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
L329054 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ No, it's...
L329053 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
L329042 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I filmed this the morning they left.
L329041 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's him. That’s Eric!
L329032 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Eric...
L329031 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Young adult.
L329029 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Just drop it Paul!
L329028 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What did you say!
L329027 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Nothing.
L329026 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What did you say?
L329025 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Nothing.
L329024 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What?
L329023 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Oh, don't worry about that.
L329022 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
L329021 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
L329020 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
L329019 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
L329018 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, Dr. Grant says...
L329017 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
L329016 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
L328997 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ So do you.
L328996 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You look good.
L328995 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ People change.
L328994 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ You hate to swim.
L328993 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
L328992 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ How much weight have you lost?
L328991 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Nothing you haven't seen before.
L328990 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sorry.
L328970 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
L328969 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
L328968 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Her new boyfriend.
L328943 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
L328942 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We can't just...
L328935 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ What's a bad idea?
L328934 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He says it's a bad idea!
L328933 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ What?
L328932 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
L328891 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
L328890 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
L328884 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
L328883 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ ...once-in-a-lifetime.
L328880 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
L328879 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
L328877 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
L328876 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
L329153 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Where is it?
L329152 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ You had the phone the whole time?
L329148 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ What about Eric?
L329147 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
L329146 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
L329145 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
L329094 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He's not a kill, he's still alive.
L329093 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
L329067 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Here!
L329066 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
L328967 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Who's that?
L328966 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
L328889 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ How low?
L328888 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
L329263 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
L329262 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ He loves you too.
L329261 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
L329260 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ then we should...
L329259 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
L329258 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
L329256 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Just hold on.
L329255 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Where's Dad?
L329253 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ DAD!
L329252 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ PAUL!
L329194 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It won't hold!
L329193 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Eric!
L329150 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Sure.
L329149 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
L329127 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Dr. Grant was.
L329126 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I thought you were an expert.
L329125 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I don’t know.
L329096 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
L329095 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
L329007 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
L329006 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
L329005 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
L328978 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I didn't know, there were two islands.
L328977 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
L329202 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
L329201 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ NO!
L329200 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I CAN GET HIM!
L329172 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
L329171 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
L329168 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Billy, I can't talk to you now.
L329167 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
L329166 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We need to keep moving.
L329088 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ KEEP GOING!
L329087 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ ALAN!
L329071 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
L329070 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ We could co-write a paper.
L329037 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We should take it with us to signal any planes.
L329036 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It looks intact.
L329004 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
L329003 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I don't remember that on InGen's list.
L329002 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
L329001 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Baryonyx?
L329000 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They never got that big.
L328999 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
L328998 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ How would you classify it?
L328938 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I don't think so.
L328937 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Is it a rex?
L328914 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
L328913 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
L328902 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
L328901 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
L328900 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
L328899 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
L328898 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That does sound lucky.
L328897 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
L328896 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
L328867 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What?
L328866 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ They're here.
L328865 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L328863 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Not if it can't dig.
L328862 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
L328861 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You rented an automated litter box.
L328860 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
L328859 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We'll be broke in four weeks.
L328858 +++$+++ u6146 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ How was your trip? Profitable?
L328837 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
L328836 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A well-accepted theory.
L328835 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
L328834 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Goodbye, Alan.
L328833 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
L328832 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
L328831 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'd better get going.
L328830 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The last of my breed.
L328829 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
L328828 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
L328827 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Good luck with the fund raising.
L328824 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ To a degree we never imagined.
L328823 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You think they could talk to each other?
L328822 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
L328821 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I try not to.
L328820 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You remember the sounds they made?
L328819 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ My favorite.
L328818 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Raptors, mostly.
L328817 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Anything good?
L328813 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Really?  What do you do there?
L328812 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
L328809 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
L328808 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ He used to know me.
L328799 +++$+++ u6147 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
L328798 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Hmm?
L329291 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
L329290 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
L329285 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ No we're not.
L329284 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ We're safe!
L329280 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
L329279 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ No. I couldn't see.
L329278 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
L329277 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You're right.
L329276 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You should.
L329275 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's strikes me now I never told her that.
L329274 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
L329273 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
L329236 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Something must've scared them.
L329235 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Bonitas.
L329223 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
L329222 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ But then you never get to go in space.
L329221 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
L329220 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I want to be an astronaut.
L329219 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
L329218 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
L329217 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Do you have any kids?
L329174 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Then we go home?
L329173 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
L329144 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
L329143 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Why?
L329142 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Are you sure?
L329141 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We need to head for the coast.
L329140 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
L329139 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ How much of this island have you explored?
L329138 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Mine's new.
L329137 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
L329136 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Know what this is?
L329121 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
L329120 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What did you think?
L329119 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Yeah.
L329118 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Did you read Malcolm's book?
L329117 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
L329116 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
L329115 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
L329114 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Found this, but the battery's dead.
L329113 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Any weapons, radios?
L329112 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
L329111 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
L329110 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
L329109 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Which one do you prefer?
L329108 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
L329107 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
L329106 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
L329105 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ On the island.
L329104 +++$+++ u6148 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ In Costa Rica?
L329103 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Eric, your parents are both here.
L329232 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Stan.
L329231 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
L329230 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
L329210 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
L329209 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Billy!
L329082 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Back out! Move!
L329081 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Amanda!
L329064 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ But you never came across just one.
L329063 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well that's good.
L329009 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
L329008 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
L328986 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
L328985 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
L328984 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
L328976 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sure you have. You wrote that book...
L328975 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I have never been on this island!
L328974 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
L328929 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
L328928 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
L328927 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
L328921 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ This plane can not land!
L328920 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
L328893 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
L328892 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's hard to believe.
L328887 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can’t fly low enough to see anything of interest.
L328886 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
L328885 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
L328882 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
L328881 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Hmmm.
L328874 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
L328873 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
L328872 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
L328871 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
