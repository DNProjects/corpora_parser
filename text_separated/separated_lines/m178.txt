L504960 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
L504959 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
L504958 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, we're from San Diego. Why?
L504957 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
L504956 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
L505013 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
L505012 +++$+++ u2736 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ The fuck was that?
L505011 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
L505010 +++$+++ u2736 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
L505009 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
L505008 +++$+++ u2736 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
L505007 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
L505006 +++$+++ u2736 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
L504121 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Bye.
L504120 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I love you.
L504119 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Bye.
L504118 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
L504117 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
L504116 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
L504115 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Why are you being so defensive?
L504114 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
L504113 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
L504112 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
L504111 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
L504110 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
L504109 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
L504108 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, then put him at the singles table.
L504107 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
L504104 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
L504103 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So what's up?
L504102 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Good. That's good.
L504101 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
L504100 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ You guys having fun?
L504099 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's Christine.  Hey you.
L504052 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ It'll just take a second.
L504051 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
L504891 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
L504890 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So I guess that's it.
L504889 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
L504888 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, I'm here.
L504887 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Are you there? Miles?
L504886 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
L504885 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Huh.
L504884 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
L504883 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And?
L504882 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
L504881 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
L504880 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ How's the trip?
L504879 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
L504878 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Miles.
L504742 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm good.
L504741 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You okay, Miles?
L504739 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
L504738 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Say, is Maya working?
L504737 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You got it.
L504736 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Bottle.
L504735 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Glass or bottle?
L504734 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Highliner.
L504733 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
L504732 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
L504731 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ How's it hanging, Miles?
L504282 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
L504281 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What do you think?
L504280 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
L504279 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
L504278 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What are you pouring tonight?
L504277 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ My condolences.
L504276 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
L504275 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
L504274 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Gary.
L504273 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
L504176 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
L504175 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
L504174 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
L504173 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
L504172 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Two years ago, buddy.
L504167 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
L504166 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
L504165 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Spray and Wash. That's the one.
L504164 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
L504163 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
L504154 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
L504153 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is it chicken?
L504152 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ They're just leftovers.
L504151 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
L504144 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
L504143 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
L504142 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
L504141 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
L504140 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
L504139 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
L504136 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
L504135 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ They're from both of us.
L504920 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
L504919 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I can explain.
L504557 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
L504556 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hi.
L504555 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
L504554 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ What happened to you guys?
L504502 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Me too.
L504501 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I'm thinking about the duck breast.
L504476 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Not so bad yourself.
L504475 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Great. You look great.  You both do.
L504474 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Good. How're you?
L504473 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
L504441 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I know. I might need to be spanked.
L504440 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
L504437 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
L504436 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Sure I know Maya. Real well.
L504435 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
L504434 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L504433 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
L504432 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
L504431 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
L504425 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice.
L504424 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Stephanie.
L504423 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
L504417 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ That's what people say.
L504416 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
L504415 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Hey, guys. How's it going?
L504496 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Well, in that case...
L504495 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
L504494 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ No, we're paying for the wine.
L504493 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
L504337 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You are not.
L504336 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I am one of those guys.
L504335 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
L504333 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Maybe. Recognize this?
L504332 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Anything I'd know?
L504331 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
L504330 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
L504329 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, I'm an actor.
L504328 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Are you a writer too?
L504319 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's on us.
L504318 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Highliner, please.
L504306 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
L504305 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hiya.
L505058 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You were wearing your belt.
L505057 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
L505056 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
L505055 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Back at you.
L505054 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Love you, man.
L505053 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah.
L505052 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
L505051 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh-uh. You're on your own.
L505050 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why don't you come in?
L505049 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well. That about does it.
L505045 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
L505044 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Whatever. Sorry.
L505043 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You broke some.
L505041 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You need a new car anyway.
L505040 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
L505039 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
L505038 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Look at this!
L505037 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll pay for it.
L505036 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What the fuck!
L505035 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You said it looked like a car accident.
L505034 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What the fuck!
L505033 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
L505032 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What's wrong?
L505031 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I feel like driving.
L505030 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm fine. You rest.
L505029 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on, let me drive.
L505028 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're so negative.
L505027 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
L505026 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
L505025 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, I'm okay.
L505024 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Want me to drive?
L505023 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Quite a week.
L505022 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yep. Quite a day.
L505021 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That was quite a day yesterday.
L505020 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hrnrnrn?
L505019 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hey, Jack. Jack.
L505005 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hold on.
L505004 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
L505003 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
L505002 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
L505001 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
L505000 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Me?
L504999 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The plan is... you go.
L504998 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what's the plan?
L504996 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
L504995 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
L504994 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
L504993 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what the fuck were you thinking?
L504992 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L504991 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She tell you she was married?
L504988 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
L504987 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Please, Miles, please.
L504986 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No way. No way.
L504985 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
L504984 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
L504983 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
L504982 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
L504981 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
L504980 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L504979 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We gotta go back.
L504978 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
L504977 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's five clicks, Jackson.
L504976 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
L504975 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
L504974 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
L504973 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L504972 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fucking chick's married.
L504968 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
L504967 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
L504955 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't know. I wouldn't know.
L504954 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
L504949 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L504948 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
L504947 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What's that?
L504946 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know what I'm thinking?
L504944 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
L504943 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's it look like to you?
L504941 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
L504940 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
L504939 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Huh. Let me think.
L504938 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
L504934 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L504933 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's thoughtful.
L504932 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
L504931 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good thing you have a voice-over career.
L504930 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
L504929 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well?
L504926 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Keep it elevated.
L504925 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
L504924 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
L504923 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
L504922 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
L504912 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
L504911 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
L504910 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
L504909 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't give up. You're going to make it.
L504908 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Thanks.
L504907 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
L504906 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
L504905 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L504904 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
L504903 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
L504874 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
L504873 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's up?
L504872 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Let me use your phone.
L504871 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
L504870 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
L504869 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I say we check it out. You never know.
L504868 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't have to.
L504867 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You ever actually been in there, Miles?
L504866 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
L504865 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
L504861 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Are they too sporty?
L504860 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
L504859 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Do you like them?
L504857 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I know what you need.
L504856 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
L504855 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
L504854 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
L504849 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
L504848 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
L504847 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
L504846 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
L504845 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
L504844 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Let's leave it alone.
L504843 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
L504842 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's private.
L504841 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L504840 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No.
L504839 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
L504836 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Put me down, Jack.
L504835 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
L504810 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh.
L504809 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
L504808 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
L504801 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I SAID OKAY?
L504800 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You have to tell me --
L504799 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I said okay?
L504798 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What exactly are we going to do?
L504797 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
L504796 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What's happening?
L504795 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We're on.
L504793 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
L504792 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Slaughterhouse.
L504791 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
L504790 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
L504789 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ With Maya.
L504788 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is what the money thing?
L504787 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is it the money thing?
L504785 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
L504784 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L504783 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
L504779 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Throw me his ball.
L504778 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
L504777 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Fucker hit into us.
L504773 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
L504772 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What is it?
L504771 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
L504770 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
L504769 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
L504768 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up.
L504767 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't come over the top. Stay still.
L504765 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
L504764 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
L504763 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh.
L504762 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Obsessively.
L504761 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Been checking your messages?
L504760 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Could be anything.
L504759 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you think's going on?
L504758 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nope.
L504757 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
L504756 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're an asshole.
L504755 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice shot.
L504753 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Thanks, Jack.
L504752 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
L504751 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh yeah. Sure.
L504750 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Can you give me some room here?
L504749 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
L504748 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nope.
L504747 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
L504745 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
L504744 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
L504728 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah.
L504727 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Call me on my cell if you go out.
L504723 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
L504722 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
L504718 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
L504717 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That was three years ago after that first party!
L504716 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
L504715 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What? Of course I like Christine.
L504714 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
L504713 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
L504712 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
L504711 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
L504710 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
L504709 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
L504708 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look who's talking. You've been there.
L504707 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
L504706 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Like I might be in love with another woman.
L504705 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Understanding of what?
L504704 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
L504702 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Deep.
L504701 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
L504699 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
L504698 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, you've been thinking. And?
L504697 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I've been doing some thinking.
L504696 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L504695 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
L504694 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Besides what?
L504693 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
L504692 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Does she know about Saturday?
L504691 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ With this chick.
L504690 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L504689 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing?
L504688 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
L504687 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Where is Stephanie?
L504684 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What're you drinking?
L504683 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yep.
L504682 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, there you are.
L504679 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
L504678 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What'd Christine say?
L504660 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Okay! Jesus!
L504659 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Right now.
L504658 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I will.  See ya!
L504657 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You should call her.
L504656 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. Okay.
L504655 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She's been leaving messages here too.
L504654 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, boy.
L504653 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
L504652 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Later.
L504651 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
L504650 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Count me out.
L504649 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
L504648 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We were supposed to play golf.
L504647 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
L504645 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
L504644 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
L504546 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
L504545 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up. Shut your face.
L504544 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
L504543 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh Jesus, Miles.
L504542 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
L504541 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
L504539 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you drink and dial?
L504538 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Bathroom.
L504537 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Where were you?
L504536 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm fine!
L504535 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pull yourself together, man.
L504471 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Okay! Fuck!
L504470 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
L504469 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
L504468 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
L504467 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
L504466 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Aye-aye, captain.
L504465 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
L504464 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
L504463 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
L504460 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
L504459 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what should I wear?
L504456 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nah. I want to watch this.
L504455 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
L504454 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
L504453 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, she is cute.
L504452 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
L504451 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Been divorced for a year now, bud.
L504450 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ With Maya?
L504449 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
L504448 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L504447 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We're on.
L504446 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You have the keys.
L504445 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Get the trunk.
L504444 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
L504443 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
L504419 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm a quick learner.
L504418 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
L504411 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
L504410 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
L504409 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
L504408 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
L504407 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
L504406 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you think?
L504405 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is she bringing him to the wedding?
L504404 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
L504403 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I want to go home now.
L504402 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
L504400 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
L504399 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ About a month ago. Six weeks.
L504398 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She what?  When?
L504397 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
L504396 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
L504395 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
L504394 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
L504393 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Miles.
L504392 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
L504391 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Beautiful.
L504390 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nice, huh?
L504376 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
L504375 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
L504374 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
L504373 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
L504372 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
L504369 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
L504368 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So what's the plan today?
L504367 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
L504364 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Fuck you.
L504363 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
L504362 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Have you no shame?
L504361 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
L504360 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up.
L504359 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
L504358 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
L504357 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How do you know?
L504356 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
L504355 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
L504354 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
L504353 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
L504352 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
L504351 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
L504350 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
L504315 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're blind, dude. Blind.
L504314 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She works for tips!
L504313 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
L504312 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
L504311 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Perfect.
L504310 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And she likes Pinot.
L504309 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
L504308 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, she does know a lot about wine.
L504307 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
L504298 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
L504297 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
L504296 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
L504295 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
L504294 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
L504293 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She is very hot.
L504292 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
L504291 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know that chick?
L504290 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure I know Maya.
L504289 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know her?
L504288 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
L504286 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's going to be great. Here's to us.
L504285 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Here's to my last week of freedom.
L504284 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Pour us a couple.
L504283 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. Tight.
L504272 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
L504271 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Then it's a good thing.
L504270 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It does. Feels right.
L504269 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ If that's what feels right.
L504268 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
L504267 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L504266 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
L504265 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So you're going to stop acting?
L504264 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
L504263 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
L504262 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
L504261 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Whoa.
L504260 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
L504259 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
L504258 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We should have driven.
L504257 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's not even a mile.
L504256 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
L504255 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just a minute!
L504254 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hey Jack, hurry up!
L504253 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Want some?
L504252 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Are you chewing gum?
L504251 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, that would be a good move.
L504250 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know, you could work in a wine store.
L504246 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
L504245 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How would you rate this one?
L504244 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now.
L504243 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ When do we get to drink it?
L504242 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's what you do with every one.
L504240 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
L504239 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
L504237 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
L504236 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What do you smell?
L504234 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
L504233 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh.
L504232 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
L504231 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What color is it supposed to be?
L504230 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
L504228 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
L504227 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
L504226 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This is rose, right?
L504220 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now we're talking.
L504219 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
L504214 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I owe her a call anyway.
L504213 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
L504212 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Let me call Christine.
L504211 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
L504210 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
L504209 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
L504208 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I told you. Filet and salmon.
L504207 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
L504206 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
L504205 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
L504203 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
L504202 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I thought you hated Chardonnay.
L504201 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
L504200 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
L504199 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
L504197 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And get your bone smooched.
L504196 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
L504195 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
L504194 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And Lexapro, yes.
L504193 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
L504192 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
L504191 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You still seeing that shrink?
L504190 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm working on it.
L504189 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
L504188 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'd rather have a knife.
L504187 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
L504185 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
L504184 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
L504183 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
L504182 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's your problem, Miles.
L504181 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
L504180 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
L504169 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
L504168 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
L504148 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
L504147 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
L504131 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's a good age.
L504130 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Um... seventy... something.
L504129 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How old's she going to be?
L504128 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
L504127 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
L504126 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
L504125 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L504124 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
L504123 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Whoa, why are we getting off?
L504098 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
L504097 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
L504096 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh yeah. Much better.
L504095 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How about the new ending? Did you like that?
L504094 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
L504093 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And?
L504092 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Yeah.
L504091 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
L504090 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sure is tasty.
L504089 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
L504088 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just tell me.
L504087 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
L504086 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
L504085 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
L504084 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, that's tasty.
L504083 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
L504082 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L504081 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
L504080 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
L504078 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
L504077 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
L504076 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Don't open that now. It's warm.
L504074 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
L504073 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
L504072 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ ...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
L504071 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, Conundrum.
L504070 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
L504069 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You said you had it all lined up.
L504068 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Why did you tell them my book was being published?
L504067 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
L504066 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on. You're fucking hungover.
L504065 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I can't help the traffic.
L504064 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
L504928 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
L504927 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
L504833 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
L504832 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
L504831 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah.
L504830 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, Maya. No.
L504829 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ But you wanted to fuck me first.
L504828 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
L504827 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm sure he believed every word.
L504826 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
L504825 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He's an actor, so it can't be good.
L504824 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Do you know what he's been saying to her?
L504823 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
L504822 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Don't touch me. Just take me home.
L504821 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Maya.
L504820 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
L504819 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Were you ever going to say anything?
L504817 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What rehearsal dinner?
L504816 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
L504815 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
L504814 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Okay.
L504813 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ About two-thirty.
L504812 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Great. What's the latest we can get there?
L504811 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
L504807 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You too.
L504806 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, nice to see you now.
L504805 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I had class.
L504804 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
L504803 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
L504642 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Goodnight, Miles.
L504641 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
L504639 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
L504638 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Um... did you still want to read my novel?
L504637 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Okay. See you around.
L504636 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good. So did I.
L504635 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
L504634 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Got it.
L504633 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
L504628 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah.
L504627 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Bathroom over there?
L504625 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Like what a fraud he was.
L504624 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah? Like what?
L504623 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
L504622 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't know. Why are you into wine?
L504621 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What about me?
L504620 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
L504618 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
L504617 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure.
L504616 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Can I ask you a personal question?
L504615 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
L504614 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
L504613 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
L504612 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Well...
L504611 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
L504610 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
L504609 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
L504608 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
L504607 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ A paper?
L504606 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
L504605 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah. Thanks.
L504604 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
L504603 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
L504602 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
L504601 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Um... yeah but it's more...
L504600 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh. You mean... today?
L504599 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ "The Day After Yesterday."
L504598 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What's the title?
L504597 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
L504596 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So what's your novel about?
L504595 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah. Definitely.
L504594 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah, weird. But great.
L504593 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
L504592 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
L504589 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah, same here.
L504588 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
L504587 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You got kids?
L504585 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
L504584 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is she sleeping or...?
L504583 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
L504582 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
L504581 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
L504580 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
L504579 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
L504578 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
L504577 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What was the bottle that did it?
L504576 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I started to get serious about seven years ago.
L504575 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How long have you been into wine?
L504574 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
L504573 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
L504572 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
L504571 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L504570 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
L504569 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
L504568 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
L504567 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So what gems do you have in your collection?
L504561 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
L504560 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She got anything good?
L504559 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Hey.
L504558 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hi.
L504530 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
L504529 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Are you all right?
L504500 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's what I'm having.
L504499 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I'm having the salmon.
L504486 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I know. I love that.
L504485 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ This is good. Little hints of clove.
L504484 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
L504483 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ On a Sauvignon Blanc?
L504482 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Twelve months in oak.
L504481 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nice. Very nice.
L504480 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Try it.
L504479 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh yeah? How is it?
L504478 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
L504477 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What are you drinking?
L504347 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ See you.
L504346 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
L504344 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ The Windmill.
L504343 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
L504325 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Good for you.
L504324 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I finished it.
L504323 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
L504322 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Sure.
L504321 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You want to join us?
L504304 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
L504303 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
L504302 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
L504301 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
L504300 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Maya, how are you?
L504299 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
L505084 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah.
L505083 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ See you over there, Miles.
L505082 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
L505081 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I'm pregnant.
L505080 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You quit drinking?
L505079 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Not me. I'm not drinking.
L505078 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
L505077 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I guess.
L505076 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
L505075 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I am.
L505074 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
L505073 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
L505072 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Universally rejected. Strike three.
L505071 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ So what's happening with your book?
L505070 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
L505069 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ So how're you doing?
L505068 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's great.
L505067 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
L505066 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That was big of him.
L505061 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
L505060 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
L504526 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
L504525 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
L504524 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
L504523 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
L504522 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
L504521 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
L504520 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Ken.
L504519 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Ken.
L504518 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
L504517 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
L504516 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hello?
L504515 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
L504514 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Where are you?
L504513 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
L504512 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
L504511 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
L504510 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
L504509 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Victoria! How the hell are you?
L504508 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Miles?
L504507 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Victoria.
L504506 +++$+++ u2742 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Hello?
L504899 +++$+++ u2740 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ POURER +++$+++ Then buy a bottle and go outside.
L504898 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I told you I need a drink.
L504897 +++$+++ u2740 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ POURER +++$+++ Sir, what are you doing?
L504895 +++$+++ u2740 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ POURER +++$+++ This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
L504894 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
L504388 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good stuff.
L504387 +++$+++ u2740 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ POURER +++$+++ Both.
L504386 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ French or American?
L504385 +++$+++ u2740 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ POURER +++$+++ About a year.
L504384 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
L504383 +++$+++ u2740 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ POURER +++$+++ About four weeks.
L504382 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How much skin and stem contact?
L504918 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
L504917 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Stephanie! Stop!
L504725 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
L504724 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ See you, Miles. You take care.
L504720 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Where?
L504719 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
L504675 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
L504674 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
L504673 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You golf?
L504672 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Oops. Sorry.
L504671 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
L504670 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Huh.
L504669 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
L504668 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ So what are you up to today, Miles?
L504667 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He had to make a phone call.
L504666 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Where's Jack?
L504665 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
L504664 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
L504663 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ That was fun last night.
L504563 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
L504562 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
L504548 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
L504547 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Should we get dessert?
L504498 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Exactement!
L504497 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
L504430 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
L504429 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
L504427 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Quaffable but far from transcendent.
L504426 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ So what do you think?
L504171 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I just got divorced. Phyllis.
L504170 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Miles, when are you going to get married again?
L504161 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
L504160 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
L504159 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
L504158 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
L504157 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You talked to Wendy?
L504156 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
L504155 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It was a surprise, Mom.
L504138 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
L504137 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ A famous actor who's getting married next week.
