L112738 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What if there is no tomorrow?
L112737 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
L112736 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No ...
L112735 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
L112440 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
L112439 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't think a week's gonna do it.
L112438 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
L112437 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
L112436 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
L112435 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
L112434 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
L112433 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
L112432 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I've never fired anyone in my life.
L112431 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
L112430 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
L112429 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
L112428 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
L112609 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ It's a miracle.
L112608 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You can trust me on this one.
L112607 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Es impossible.

L112605 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Is she dying?
L112589 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
L112588 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ She say she in great pain.
L112587 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
L112586 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
L112585 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ No, no, that's impossible.
L112584 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Pregnant.
L112583 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
L112597 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ We are virgins.
L112596 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No underwear?
L112595 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
L112594 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ In that time, you ever have sex?
L112593 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Two years. Ever since we left island.
L112592 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You know each other a long time?
L112717 +++$+++ u4260 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ KANITA +++$+++ Stressed? He's psycho.
L112716 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
L112715 +++$+++ u4260 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ KANITA +++$+++ He flipped out.
L112714 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Frank, take it easy. what happened?
L112674 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
L112673 +++$+++ u4260 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ KANITA +++$+++ He looks like a cop.
L112672 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
L112667 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Mary ...
L112666 +++$+++ u4260 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ KANITA +++$+++ Hey Cy, guess who's here?
L112837 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
L112836 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.
L112835 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
L112834 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Dead.
L112833 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ What about Kanita?
L112832 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I was tired. I needed a coffee.
L112831 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
L112830 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're going to live.
L112829 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ So, Frank, am I going to live?
L112828 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I can't hold up my head anymore.
L112827 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
L112825 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ No!
L112824 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Does that hurt?
L112700 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Just take it easy.
L112699 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I guess I'll be going.
L112697 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
L112696 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is this what you gave Mary?
L112695 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
L112694 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I should be going. I just quit.
L112693 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
L112692 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
L112691 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
L112690 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Got a beer?
L112689 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
L112687 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mary, we really have to go.
L112686 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ She wanted something to help her sleep.
L112681 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I better just go in and see her.
L112680 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
L112679 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She asked me to pick her up.
L112678 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Sleeping in the back.
L112677 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where is she?
L112676 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Mary said you might be coming.
L112675 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Frank Pierce.
L112639 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four.
L112638 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
L112637 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
L112580 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four, hon.
L112579 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
L112578 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
L112577 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
L112576 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
L112575 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
L112456 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
L112455 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
L112454 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
L112453 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
L112472 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
L112471 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ IB Bangin.
L112470 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What's his name?
L112469 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
L112462 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
L112461 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ No way, man.
L112460 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No. He's dead.
L112459 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ He's going to be all right, right?
L112458 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Okay, what happened?
L112908 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
L112907 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Oh man, Bucky.
L112906 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
L112905 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah?
L112904 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Sure, sure, give go.
L112903 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, I'd better not.
L112902 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Here, you try.
L112901 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
L112900 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
L112389 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
L112388 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ What did you say?
L112387 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're not going to die.
L112364 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
L112363 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
L112362 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
L112359 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ No, no medicine!
L112358 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
L112357 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
L112226 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
L112225 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
L112944 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Come on up.
L112943 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Frank.
L112942 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Who is it?
L112870 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ There's no time.
L112869 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This is not a good time.
L112866 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
L112865 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
L112864 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
L112863 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
L112862 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
L112861 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
L112860 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
L112859 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
L112858 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He'll be all right.
L112857 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
L112729 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
L112728 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I need to sit down a minute.
L112727 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
L112724 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Because you can barely walk.
L112723 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
L112685 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, no.
L112684 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
L112664 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
L112663 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
L112662 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
L112661 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Fifteen minutes.
L112660 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Promise you won't go inside.
L112659 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You asked me not to come.
L112658 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I shouldn't have asked you to come.
L112657 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
L112656 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
L112655 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
L112654 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe I should come up with you.
L112653 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
L112652 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay.
L112651 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
L112650 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't seem so bad to me.
L112649 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
L112648 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
L112558 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sure.
L112557 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
L112556 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
L112555 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
L112554 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think I'd remember that.
L112553 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
L112552 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
L112551 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
L112550 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Five years.
L112549 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How long you been doing this?
L112548 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
L112545 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
L112544 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You married?
L112543 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
L112542 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
L112541 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We moved out after that. Upstate.
L112540 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
L112539 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
L112538 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
L112537 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
L112536 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Not as good as Nino's.
L112535 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
L112534 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
L112530 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
L112529 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's better.
L112528 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's better, though, right?
L112527 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
L112526 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
L112525 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
L112512 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Okay.
L112511 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
L112510 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
L112509 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
L112508 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sleeping.
L112507 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How is she?
L112506 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
L112505 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think it looks good.
L112504 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
L112503 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You look so different.
L112502 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
L112501 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
L112500 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's better, isn't he?
L112499 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll be right down.
L112498 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
L112497 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes?
L112415 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
L112414 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She should go home.
L112413 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
L112412 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
L112411 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's working a double shift.
L112410 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
L112409 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.
L112408 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Did you see my father?
L112407 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Our Lady of Misery.
L112406 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I think this place stinks.
L112405 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112404 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's dead, huh?
L112403 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112402 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
L112400 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
L112399 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
L112398 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You shouldn't smoke.
L112333 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
L112332 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
L112331 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
L112330 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
L112329 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
L112328 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ At least he's got people around him.
L112327 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
L112326 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You never know.
L112325 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
L112324 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The first is always the best.
L112323 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's my first cigarette in over a year.
L112258 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
L112257 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
L112253 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I guess there's always a chance.
L112252 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is there any chance?
L112251 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We'd better go outside. Quickly.
L112250 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know him. That's Noel.
L112249 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's very very sick.
L112207 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ His heart's beating.
L112206 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is he going to be alright?
L112201 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ John, play the Sinatra.
L112200 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
L112199 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What?
L112198 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do you have any music?
L112644 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You can't leave me now.
L112643 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I quit! I'm through!
L112642 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Where you going?
L112634 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Greatest job in the world.
L112633 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Here's to the greatest job in the world.
L112632 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'll drink to that.
L112631 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
L112630 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I hate vodka.
L112628 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
L112627 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
L112626 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
L112625 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What look?
L112624 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't give me that look.
L112604 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ It's coming.
L112603 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Backup?
L112602 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ That's too many.
L112601 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Three legs.
L112600 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What's that, Frank?
L112599 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's coming.  Hold her down.
L112582 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's wrong.
L112581 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
L112574 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I need a drink, that's all.
L112573 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
L112570 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
L112569 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
L112568 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's no whore, Marcus.
L112567 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
L112562 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
L112561 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
L112560 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
L112532 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thanks.
L112531 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
L112517 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ God help us, he's hungry too.
L112516 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
L112515 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
L112514 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
L112513 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Who's that?
L112495 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Make a left here. I want to stop.
L112494 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
L112493 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
L112492 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
L112464 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
L112463 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
L112452 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She loves me the way no woman ever has.
L112451 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
L112450 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
L112447 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
L112446 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think the worst is over.
L112445 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
L112444 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The ghosts--
L112443 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
L112442 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
L112441 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
L112932 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
L112931 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where's Burke?
L112930 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Crazy fucker.
L112929 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.
L112928 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
L112927 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Last show of the night.
L112853 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ A medical miracle.
L112852 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
L112851 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
L112850 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
L112849 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How many times have you shocked him tonight?
L112848 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ You can't believe how much he's improved.
L112614 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
L112613 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
L112490 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
L112489 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The family know?
L112488 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
L112487 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What do you think?
L112486 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
L112485 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
L112240 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
L112239 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He one of them?
L112232 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
L112231 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He got better.
L112952 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112951 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ Would you like to come in?
L112950 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
L112949 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L112948 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ He was tough. You did all you could.
L112947 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
L112946 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ How can that be? He was getting better.
L112945 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
L112923 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You're crazy.
L112922 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
L112921 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Frank!
L112920 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do it!
L112919 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Frank!
L112918 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
L112898 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You learn that in the army?
L112897 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
L112896 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L112895 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
L112894 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay, whatta I do?
L112893 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
L112892 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
L112891 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's crazy. He can't help it.
L112890 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
L112887 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Let me think.
L112886 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
L112885 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
L112884 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
L112883 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Why?
L112882 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't know--let's break some windows.
L112881 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ What do you want to break?
L112880 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
L112879 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
L112878 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Who with?
L112877 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Let's get in a fight, then.
L112876 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
L112875 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
L112873 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
L112872 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
L112871 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
L112823 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
L112822 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How's he doing?
L112821 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
L112820 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
L112819 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
L112809 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Better bring it all.
L112808 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Whadda we bring?
L112803 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
L112802 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's early for him.
L112801 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Mr. Oh.
L112796 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I never felt better in my life.
L112795 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You okay?
L112794 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've taken that into consideration.
L112793 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ The brakes are shot.
L112792 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
L112791 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Whatja doing?
L112790 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
L112789 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Where you going?
L112773 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look out!
L112772 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
L112768 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
L112767 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
L112766 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
L112765 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
L112764 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
L112763 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
L112762 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Yeah. Great, isn't it?
L112761 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ These are hard times, Tom.
L112760 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
L112759 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
L112372 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
L112371 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
L112713 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No way!
L112712 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Stomach again.
L112711 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ One more time!
L112710 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're in the stomach! Let me try.
L112705 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You sure?
L112704 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're in the stomach!
L112367 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Used to be my partner.
L112366 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
L112356 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You really think so?
L112355 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He's crazy.
L112346 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
L112345 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
L112344 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, you're right.
L112343 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
L112342 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
L112341 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
L112340 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
L112337 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Relax, will you.
L112336 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
L112315 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Faster!
L112314 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Faster! God!
L112306 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He's drunk.
L112305 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well why didn't you say so?
L112301 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
L112300 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They'll just keep calling.
L112299 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
L112298 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
L112291 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
L112290 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mr. Oh.
L112285 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're burned out.
L112284 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't push it, Larry.
L112283 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
L112282 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
L112279 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You know what. The radio.
L112278 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L112277 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Turn it off.
L112273 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
L112272 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
L112271 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
L112270 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L112269 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
L112268 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L112267 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Oh no!--I just remembered.
L112263 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
L112262 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
L112261 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
L112205 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ No shit.
L112204 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No we can't. He's got a pulse.
L112297 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
L112296 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
L112295 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
L112294 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds.
L112293 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
L112292 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
L112289 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
L112288 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
L112287 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
L112286 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
