L349971 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ We did a lot of the wiring too.
L349970 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
L349774 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ He was there and then he wasn't!
L349773 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Dad's disappeared!
L348950 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
L348949 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L348948 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Marco!
L350031 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It's so beautiful.
L350030 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ When does George get to come see his house?
L349763 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
L349762 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He's here.  Check the bathroom.
L349761 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ He's not there.
L349753 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I guess it depends on what you give up on.
L349752 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
L349664 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
L349663 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And video games after!
L349538 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Since seventh grade.
L349537 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Did you know him before you knew Dad?
L349511 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Sam!
L349510 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
L349467 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We can work.
L349466 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
L349465 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I wanna be with you today.
L349464 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
L349461 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I thought I might stop by.
L349460 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Are you going to see Sam again?
L350023 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I love red!  That's my favorite color!
L350022 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Red.
L350021 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What color?
L350020 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Do you guys feel like painting?
L349776 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Who are you?
L349775 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He hasn't called?
L349600 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I don't think Dad wants you home.
L349599 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So put your plans of my room in the trash.
L349516 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I would have anyway.
L349515 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh.
L349514 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Mom said I should.
L349513 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's that for?
L349942 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Who are all these people?
L349941 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Atonement.
L349927 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
L349926 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
L349925 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Has he eaten anything at all?
L349924 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm going to bed.
L349768 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Uh...using Josh like that.
L349767 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Why?  What do you mean?
L349766 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
L349765 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I couldn't sleep last night.
L349764 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What are you doing up so early?
L349747 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Oh God, we don't want the police!
L349746 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ You'd better call and cancel.
L349745 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
L349744 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ And why was the alarm on?
L349743 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I couldn't get it to go down.
L349742 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L349741 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I put him to work.
L349739 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Here, honey!
L349738 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Mom?
L349732 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
L349731 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What did you think it would be?
L349730 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ It's not what I was expecting.
L349728 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let's shut up and not kill her.
L349727 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ My mother would die.
L349725 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
L349724 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Did you feel anything?
L349723 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
L349722 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I want you to try something with me, okay?
L349721 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You have to ask like that?
L349720 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
L349719 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're a good girl.
L349718 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
L349717 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
L349716 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
L349715 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Can you keep Sam straight?
L349124 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
L349123 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I had them in my pocket.
L349121 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What's that?
L349120 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My keys.
L349119 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Monday.
L349118 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's today?
L349116 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Nope.
L349115 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Don't you have school?
L349114 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Is that legal?
L349113 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm living here while I build another house.
L349112 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
L349111 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Alyssa.
L348907 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
L348906 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why?
L348905 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ No.
L348904 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Are you his friend?
L348903 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He seems lonely.
L348902 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He must.
L348900 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll survive.
L348899 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Sorry I got you into trouble.
L349996 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What?
L349995 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Floating to Catalina.
L349994 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Where are you?!
L349952 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't wanna go.
L349951 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
L349950 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't wanna go.
L349935 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Not if what he left me was real.
L349934 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You'd hate him for the trick.
L349933 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
L349932 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You hate your father.
L349813 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What?
L349812 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
L349807 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Are you afraid of heights?
L349806 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ On the handlebars or your shoulders?
L349646 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay.  I guess.
L349645 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
L349644 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
L349643 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
L349642 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It would help me if I could kiss you.
L349641 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I thought I was helping you.
L349640 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
L349639 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Not really.
L349638 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
L349637 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I was wondering.
L349635 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not gay.
L349634 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Josh said...
L349633 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L349632 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Are you sure you're totally into guys?
L349631 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
L349630 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Does everything have to have a point?
L349629 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's the point of this?
L349496 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
L349495 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
L349494 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
L349493 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Why are you so uptight?
L349492 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why are you so stupid?
L349491 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ We're not gonna do anything.
L349490 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't want you to!
L349489 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm coming in.
L349488 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
L349487 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
L349485 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
L349484 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
L349483 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
L349482 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
L349481 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Really?
L349480 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
L349479 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
L349477 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm okay.
L349476 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can use your mom's.
L349475 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Huh?
L349257 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No thanks.
L349256 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
L349255 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Turn over.
L349254 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why?
L349253 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I wanted him to marry her.
L349252 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Really?
L349251 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
L349250 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L349249 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Do you remember me from when you lived here?
L349246 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.  That's okay.
L349245 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'll get your back.
L349244 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I might not stay, anyway.
L349243 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
L349242 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can't even take a shower here.
L349241 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ You look better without make-up.
L349240 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He's a freak.
L349221 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Tell him I said "hi".
L349220 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He jumped into the ocean.
L349219 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Where's your dad?
L349218 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349217 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ You should stay.
L349216 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
L349215 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349214 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Your dad's really gonna build his house?
L349213 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
L349212 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Where to?
L349211 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
L349210 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L349209 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey.
L349208 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Hi.
L349207 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
L349898 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ No.
L349897 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Will he talk to me?
L349896 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He won't leave my room.
L349657 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He's not the type to worry.
L349656 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
L349655 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Well, he doesn't need to worry.
L349654 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
L349653 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He's at work while I'm here.
L349652 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
L349651 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why is that?
L349528 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He's got a standing invitation.
L349527 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
L350001 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
L350000 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
L348926 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
L348925 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
L348924 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
L348923 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I wouldn't want you as a friend.
L348919 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
L348918 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ We've known each other since grade school.
L348917 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Are you guys' friends?
L348914 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ You've been good this week.
L348913 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ It could have been a squirt gun.
L348912 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ And of course the Beck's, with the...
L348911 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
L348910 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
L348909 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ This is such a street of whiners.
L349919 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Months.
L349918 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That would take weeks.
L349912 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
L349911 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
L349910 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I have the permit.
L349909 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Well, if it is, we have a problem.
L349908 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's thirty feet.
L349907 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
L349426 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ If that's what it takes.
L349425 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
L349422 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I flushed it down the toilet.
L349421 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I hate to ask about a window.
L349413 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Allowed outside the enclosed area.
L349412 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A sink?
L349411 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ An exhaust system or a window is code.
L349410 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And if I enclosed it?
L349409 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L349408 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A violation?
L349407 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
L349406 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've been dreading you.
L349405 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Mr. Stevens?
L349017 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L349016 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Well, it's the least I can do.
L349015 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thank you.
L349014 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
L349013 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
L349012 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ What can I do for you, George?
L349011 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've got one favor to ask.
L349010 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good.  I was hoping for that.
L349009 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Well, I feel better about this now.
L349008 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ For everything.
L349007 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
L349006 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
L349005 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
L349004 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
L349003 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?  You love your job.
L349002 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I hate this job.
L349001 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
L348999 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
L348998 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
L348997 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
L348996 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Forty.
L348995 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How old are you?
L348994 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Oh.
L348991 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ That's too long.
L348990 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Maybe...?
L348989 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Maybe that's too long.
L348988 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've been here twenty years.
L348987 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
L348986 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm not.
L348985 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
L348984 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
L348983 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
L348982 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
L348981 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
L348980 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
L348979 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He buys and sells the world.
L348978 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Right...she married...what was he?
L348977 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
L348976 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ How's your wife?
L348975 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
L348974 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ how much weight have you lost?
L348973 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Pardon me?
L348972 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ What are you on?
L348971 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm good, thanks.
L349886 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
L349885 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
L349884 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Is Alyssa here?
L349474 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We're getting out of the ground today.
L349473 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ You're here early today.
L349472 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thank you.
L349471 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ If she's not up, you can use my shower.
L349350 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
L349349 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
L349345 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I want you both to stay.
L349344 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks for the shower.
L349324 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not a shower.
L349323 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
L349322 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L349321 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I didn't recognize you!
L349320 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Uh huh.
L349319 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Sam?
L349318 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh...okay.
L349317 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ She didn't really say.
L349316 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
L349315 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ She's out with a friend.
L349314 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Is Alyssa home?
L349836 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
L349835 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hello?
L349129 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ And you thought they might be under her dress?
L349128 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I forgot where I put my keys.
L348864 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
L348863 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I did warn you.
L348862 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
L348861 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ You'll have to explain that to the police.
L348860 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The plumber's due out on Friday.
L348859 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ George, this is the third time.
L348858 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There are no windows facing my...exposure.
L348857 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
L348856 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He escaped.  He's going back in.
L348855 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ This has got to stop!
L349109 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
L349108 +++$+++ u1798 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
L349107 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
L349106 +++$+++ u1798 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
L349105 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'll ask.
L349104 +++$+++ u1798 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
L349103 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349102 +++$+++ u1798 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
L349980 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Here.
L349979 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't wanna go, Sam.
L349883 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
L349882 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
L349881 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
L349880 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
L349879 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You lied to me!
L349878 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
L349876 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.
L349875 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And you told Mom today?
L349873 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
L349872 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I still don't know what that means.
L349871 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The kind where there isn't really an answer.
L349870 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
L349867 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
L349866 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I still don't know what that means.
L349865 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The kind where there isn't really an answer.
L349864 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
L349862 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
L349861 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Are you taking them still?
L349860 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
L349859 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's wrong with your back?
L349858 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She seemed upset.
L349857 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
L349856 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You look better than ever.
L349798 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
L349797 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
L349591 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's so weird...
L349590 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ After everything.
L349589 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ After everything he did to you and your mom?
L349588 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I loved him too much.
L349587 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Do you ever wish you had done it?
L349586 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
L349585 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I would have killed him.
L349584 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
L349583 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why wouldn't she leave?
L349582 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ To hide a black eye.
L349581 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sun glasses?
L349580 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
L349579 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Are you talking?
L349576 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
L349575 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm proud of you, Sam.
L349574 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
L349573 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ If I asked you to stop, would you?
L349572 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Getting high, I guess.
L349571 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What would you be doing now?
L349570 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
L349569 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I gave up on you.
L349568 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm telling you now.
L349567 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wish you had told me then.
L349566 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
L349565 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
L349564 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He's got nothing to do with me.
L349563 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
L349562 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What do you know about me?
L349561 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know parts of who you are.
L349560 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
L349559 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's not true.
L349558 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nothing.
L349557 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What are you now?
L349556 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What I'm not.
L349555 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What would you like to be?
L349554 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How do you become something you're not?
L349553 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know the feeling.
L349552 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I like how it feels not to feel.
L349551 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know.  Why?
L349550 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I took some of your Vicodin.
L349524 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi, Mom.
L349523 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hi, Alyssa.
L349456 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Try it.  It feels good.
L349455 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
L349454 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
L349453 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't.  I don't want it.
L349452 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
L349447 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
L349446 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not even listening.
L349445 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
L349444 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'll have to pay him back.
L349443 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
L349442 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
L349441 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
L349440 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
L349438 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L349437 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Sit down for a second.
L349436 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You can't make me do a thing.
L349435 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The gloves on the table are for you.
L349434 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're too fucking late.
L349433 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
L349432 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
L349417 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I might have a solution.
L349416 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Did you got through my pants?
L349415 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A friend of yours is here.
L349414 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Where is it?
L349360 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh, okay.
L349359 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, until you know, you can't go.
L349358 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349357 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When are you going to be back?
L349356 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349355 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L349354 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey...hey!
L349353 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm leaving.
L349313 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'll have money when you work for it.
L349312 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
L349310 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
L349309 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can promise you complete privacy.
L349308 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
L349307 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't beg.
L349306 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
L349305 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
L349304 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It'll be fine.
L349303 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not doing it!
L349302 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'd blame you.  I want you here.
L349301 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No one would blame me if I left!
L349299 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're so predictable.
L349298 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'll have money when you work.
L349297 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
L349296 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know.
L349269 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
L349268 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
L349267 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It bugs me.
L349266 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why?
L349265 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
L349264 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No you don't.
L349263 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I hate turkey.
L349262 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
L349261 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L349260 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
L349237 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
L349236 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I warned you yesterday.
L349235 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you doing?!
L349228 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Goodnight.
L349227 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Probably in the bible.
L349203 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I almost saw Catalina.
L349202 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Are you totally insane?!
L349184 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
L349183 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'll hate you forever.
L349182 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
L349181 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If you hit me, I'll call the police.
L349180 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
L349173 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Mom...please.
L349172 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You don't have a choice.
L349171 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not going!
L349168 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You have everything?
L349167 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
L349166 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll get your bag.
L349165 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not going!
L349164 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'll know me by the time we're through.
L349163 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
L349154 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No I'm not!
L349153 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
L349150 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
L349149 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Because I live there.
L349148 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why would you be there?
L349147 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll be around to check up on you.
L349146 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ To check up on me?
L349145 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
L349051 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
L349050 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
L349049 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
L349048 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
L349047 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I haven't been touched in years.
L349046 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Good for you.
L349045 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can die trying.
L349044 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Can you build a house in four months?
L349043 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
L349042 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
L349040 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You know what mortise and tenon is?
L349039 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ What kind of house?
L349038 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'd build a house.
L349037 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ What would you do?
L349036 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good for you.
L349035 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ I'd eat a lot of red meat.
L349915 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't let him.  He just loves to.
L349914 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
L349892 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I want you to find someone for me.
L349891 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ God, you look like crap, George.
L349890 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I need you to do me a favor.
L349889 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
L349352 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
L349351 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ I'm surprised he hasn't left.
L349342 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
L349341 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
L349339 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ I know there's an explanation.
L349338 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Ah!  Oh....
L348933 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ At least your father tried, George.
L348932 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks for telling me.
L348931 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
L348930 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
L348929 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
L348928 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Left you this place.
L348927 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
L348922 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
L348921 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I aimed high.
L349826 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ I don't even care if he ever comes back.
L349825 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's a little sad, is all.
L349824 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Because Dad left?
L349823 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She needs to be alone, I think.
L349822 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ It's okay.
L349821 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh.  Sorry.
L349820 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ I just wanted to know where Mom was?
L349596 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Three.
L349595 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ How many bedrooms will your house have?
L349854 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Not a perfect day.
L349853 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I better get the kids home.
L349846 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm an idiot to have you up there.
L349845 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Don't move!
L349802 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's not my back that's killing me.
L349801 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Are you going to kiss me?
L349800 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ So could I.
L349799 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I could die.
L349792 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?
L349791 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Back.  Neck.  Back.
L349787 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ 'I'll be in the bedroom.'
L349786 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What did he say?
L349785 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
L349784 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Left you?
L349783 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Peter left me yesterday.
L349782 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No.  Mostly me.
L349781 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
L349780 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I didn't think you'd come today.
L349779 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Is your back still killing you?
L349695 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
L349694 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I need to know.
L349693 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let's not do this, okay?
L349692 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ If I weren't married?
L349691 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You bit my finger.
L349690 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm married.
L349689 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can't pick you up.
L349688 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It sounded like a pick-up line.
L349687 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
L349686 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You've never said that before.
L349685 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That was the truth.
L349684 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
L349683 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What did I say?
L349682 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
L349681 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Going on?
L349680 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Nothing is going on with us, is it?
L349677 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can hire workers to help me.
L349676 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I thought we were helping.
L349675 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'd rather you not be here.
L349674 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
L349673 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
L349672 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
L349671 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
L349670 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
L349669 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
L349668 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
L349546 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
L349545 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Let's see if you've gotten any better.
L349541 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Watch out for the smile, boys.
L349540 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I smiled at him.
L349539 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
L349536 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ This was my very first slow dance.
L349535 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's been a while.
L349509 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I think so.
L349508 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you need help?
L349507 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're a good mother.
L349506 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
L349505 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll find something that won't kill them.
L349504 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
L349503 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You brought your kids?
L349502 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
L349501 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where's Sam?
L349500 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
L349499 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
L349498 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My stupid back.
L349497 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I thought you'd be up with the sun.
L349401 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You're not well.
L349400 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ With your hands or your tongue?
L349398 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
L349397 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I've been wrong a lot in my life.
L349395 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
L349394 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Go in there and lick his attitude.
L349393 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
L349392 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh...with his ear infection!
L349391 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
L349390 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
L349389 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
L349388 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Finished or unfinished?
L349387 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I dreamed about your house last night.
L349386 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's not breakfast yet.
L349295 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
L349294 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What is it?
L349292 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
L349291 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
L349290 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
L349289 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you remember?
L349288 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
L349287 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What have you been before today?
L349286 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
L349281 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Sam's favorite.
L349280 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
L349279 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ The first and the last.
L349278 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Which?
L349277 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
L349276 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ But you hated four out of the five you did.
L349275 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I used to live here.
L349274 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?
L349273 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It makes me sad.
L349272 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Well, for later then.
L349271 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
L349175 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
L349174 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ George --
L349170 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let's go.
L349169 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I did say he could go.
L349162 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
L349161 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No.  I was going to let you do that.
L349160 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
L349159 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Last time you were gone for a week!
L349158 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can't leave the house?
L349157 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I drove over and you were gone.
L349156 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't have a phone.
L349155 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
L349101 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm married.
L349100 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey, hey!
L349097 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No, you don't.  Trust me.
L349096 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I want him with me.
L349095 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
L349094 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ At least we'll have a house to show for it.
L349093 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ One of you would end up dead.
L349092 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
L349091 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
L349090 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
L349089 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
L349088 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
L349087 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
L349086 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
L349085 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
L349084 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When's school over?
L349083 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
L349082 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The garage.
L349081 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where will you live?
L349080 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I love those doors.
L349079 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
L349078 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
L349077 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Money?
L349076 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There's nothing anymore to stop me.
L349075 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
L349074 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
L349073 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why call me?
L349072 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was parked in day parking.
L349071 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why would they tow your truck?
L349070 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I need to talk to you.
L349069 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
L349068 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ But you can't call me while you think?
L349067 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Kurt's been feeding him.
L349066 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What did you do with your dog?
L349065 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Four days.  I left to think.
L349064 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where have you been for a week?!
L349063 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A blueprint spool.
L349062 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
L349061 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
L349060 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
L349059 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What?
L349058 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
L349057 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
L349056 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
L349055 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
L348955 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
L348954 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why does he have a lock on his door?
L348953 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He never answers.
L348952 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He doesn't answer.
L348951 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L348942 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where he always is.
L348941 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Where is he?
L348940 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Lock the door behind you.
L348939 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You let him pierce his nose?
L348938 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
L348937 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Ring the bell before you try the door.
L348936 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You should lock your doors.
L349815 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ I could use the money.
L349814 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
L349377 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm thinking it's too weird now.
L349376 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
L349374 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
L349373 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I wasn't sure.
L349372 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Don't even...I'm there.
L349371 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's your deal with Alyssa?
L349336 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ You got the money?
L349335 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You got any weed?
L349334 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Nothing.
L349333 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Does Alyssa know?
L349332 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
L348885 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L348884 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Been thinking?
L350016 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The payoff.
L350015 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Then you tell me, what just happened?
L350014 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
L350013 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ What the fuck?
L350010 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
L350009 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L349998 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Who?
L349997 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ He said he heard hammering.
L349992 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I feel in love with George again.
L349991 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
L349990 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I hardly recognize you with a beard.
L349711 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'll be in the bedroom.
L349710 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Sam took them to a movie.
L349709 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where are the kids?
L349708 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Please don't leave me.
L349707 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ That's the problem.
L349706 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I never asked for more.
L349705 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Despite you.
L349704 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You live a fabulous life, Robin.
L349703 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You never really trusted me.
L349702 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
L349701 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What are you doing home?
L349700 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
L349628 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I know.
L349627 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I was talking about our marriage.
L349625 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
L349624 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
L349623 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You can't go with me because of Sam?
L349622 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
L349621 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You can't go because of Sam?
L349620 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't go right now.
L349619 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
L349618 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
L349617 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L349616 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm helping George build his house.
L349615 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
L349614 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ After the kids are back in school.
L349613 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sooner than the Fall.
L349612 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
L349610 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
L349609 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ The biggest waste of time since television.
L349608 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We should take a vacation.
L349607 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ To shave your chest?
L349368 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'd be you.
L349367 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
L349366 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
L349365 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It would worry me.
L349364 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Should I?
L349363 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
L349328 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'll make you something.
L349327 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
L349326 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ We've eaten.
L348869 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ A man he respects.
L348868 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ His father is a man.
L348867 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
L350027 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Do you like red?
L350026 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
L350025 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Either do you.
L350024 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You don't look like you.
L348875 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
L348874 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do it now!
L348873 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Take it off.
L348872 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L348871 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you wearing eye shadow?
L348870 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
L349989 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay.
L349988 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ I guess I could teach you some things.
L349987 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.
L349986 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Do you know anything about building a house?
L349966 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Why?
L349965 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I've missed you guys.
L349964 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ It's not ours.  It's George's.
L349963 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You got a dog?
L349962 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Hey.
L349961 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hey.
L350039 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
L350038 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
L350037 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is what he wants.
L350036 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You could keep it and rent it out?
L350035 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L350034 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You're sure about this?
L349795 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
L349794 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I don't know what I'm doing.
L349793 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The door was open.
L349756 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Depends on what I'd give up on.
L349755 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Can you stay for dinner?
L349754 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
L348962 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
L348961 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I didn't go in your room.
L348960 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you doing in my room?
L349760 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ In the bedroom.
L349759 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Dad's home, already?
L349758 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Go tell your father we're eating.
L349662 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
L349661 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Nothing R, okay?
L349603 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
L349602 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L349601 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Adam, that's not true!
L349534 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Someone stop her!
L349533 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I brought a few of my own.
L349469 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Can we really help build a house?
L349468 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
L349463 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
L349462 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ All day again?
L349459 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I just thought it would be nice.
L349458 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
L348879 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Dad said it first.
L348878 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What did you say?
L348877 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Queer.
L348850 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He'll be gone for his birthday.
L348849 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Why?
L348848 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
