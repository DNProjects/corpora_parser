L291998 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ We don't have proof of that.
L291997 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It might have been her mother.
L291996 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
L291955 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Colleen.
L291954 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ What was her name?
L291953 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
L291951 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
L291950 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Did you find something?
L291949 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
L291948 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ What's the matter?
L291947 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Damn it.
L291914 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You say you saw some activity here?
L291913 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
L292147 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Good-bye.
L292146 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Good-bye.
L292139 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ There's no need to be.
L292138 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L292137 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It will heal.
L292136 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How's your arm?
L292135 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ A few years older, perhaps.
L292134 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Are you all right?
L292048 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No!
L292047 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Did you find her?!
L292033 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why don't you pass me your plate?
L292032 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It looks delicious...
L292022 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yes.  It was.
L292021 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
L292020 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
L292019 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
L292018 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
L292017 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How did you meet Dr. Shea?
L292016 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
L292015 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
L292014 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
L291934 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
L291933 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What will they tell you?
L291932 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Town records are coming up now.
L291909 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Suppose not.
L291908 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ They don't build them like this anymore.
L292081 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
L292080 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What do these ingredients mean?
L292079 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
L292078 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I don't understand.
L292077 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ By freeing them.
L292076 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ By killing them?
L292075 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
L292074 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
L292073 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Where does this amulet come from?
L291995 +++$+++ u5928 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ That poor little girl.
L291994 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
L292240 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ I'm ok mommy.
L292239 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
L292197 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
L292196 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Your father doesn't love us anymore!
L292180 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Go to your room!  Now!
L292179 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ H-how long will it take?
L292175 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ We'll get it later.
L292174 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ What about all my other stuff?
L292173 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ We're going to go someplace new.
L292172 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Where are we going to go, mommy?
L292143 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
L292142 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Are we leaving mommy?
L292120 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ I'm scared!
L292119 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ My angel!
L292027 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Ok...
L292026 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
L291973 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ She's down...how do you mean honey?
L291972 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ She's down...
L291960 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ She talks to me.
L291959 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Can you talk to her?
L291958 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Yes.
L291957 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
L291880 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ No it won't - no it won't!
L291879 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ It's going to hurt us!
L291850 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Who...is Colleen?
L291849 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Maybe it was Colleen...
L291848 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Well then who did?!
L291847 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ I didn't do anything, mommy.
L291846 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Don't play games with me, little girl.
L291828 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
L291827 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Can I do it again tonight?
L291826 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Well I bet you they're happy.
L291825 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
L291777 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Sure.
L291776 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
L292096 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ My God, I heard something!
L292095 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Help me!  Please!!!
L291976 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Take me to her.
L291975 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ She's down.  Help her...
L291970 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ She's hiding.
L291969 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Where is she now?
L291968 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ She's here.
L291967 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Where is she?
L291966 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ She says she's lonely...
L292235 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
L292234 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Mommy!
L292166 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Good night daddy.
L292165 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Good night Angel...
L292151 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well, that all depends.
L292150 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Are we going back to California daddy?
L292114 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Daddy help!
L292113 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh my God!  She's in there!
L292109 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Daddy, please!!!
L292108 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Don't be afraid!
L292107 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Mommy please help me!
L292103 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
L292102 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ I can't move!
L292098 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ It's dark!  I can't breathe!
L292097 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
L291816 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That's great, honey.
L291815 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Look daddy!  It's empty!
L291774 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Did you ever see a leprechaun?
L291773 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
L291772 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
L291759 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ For good luck honey.
L291758 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Why?
L291757 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ He's blessing the house.
L291756 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ What's he doing daddy?
L291704 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
L291703 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ I want this one, daddy.
L291702 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Sure.  Did you see the others?
L291701 +++$+++ u5929 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ AUBREY +++$+++ Can I have this room daddy?
L292245 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm all right...
L292244 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ You're bleeding.
L292242 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I'm ok.
L292241 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Are you all right?
L292237 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ What's happening!
L292236 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Maura!
L292233 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No...  NO!
L292232 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
L292190 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
L292189 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ We're not going.
L292188 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Maura, what is this!
L292187 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L292186 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
L292185 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L292184 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Do you think I'm a fool?
L292183 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Know what?
L292182 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ You don't think I know?
L292162 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
L292161 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Should I...
L292160 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
L292159 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Ok...
L292158 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I'm fine.
L292155 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
L292154 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
L292046 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Aubrey!
L292045 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Aubrey!
L292044 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
L292043 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ She's gone!
L292042 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Oh my God where is she!
L292025 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
L292024 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I think everything's ready.
L292023 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ How are we doing?
L291964 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
L291963 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A friend?
L291962 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ She has a...friend.  Colleen.
L291961 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L291923 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Are you ok?
L291922 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Whoa there...
L291890 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
L291889 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It just disappeared.  Literally.
L291875 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
L291874 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
L291873 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
L291872 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ What about keeping an open mind?
L291871 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh come on!
L291870 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
L291869 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Who?
L291868 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
L291867 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
L291866 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
L291865 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
L291864 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Well what do you think it is?
L291863 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
L291862 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ But do you agree with me?
L291861 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I don't know what I'm saying.
L291860 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So what are you saying?
L291859 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
L291844 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
L291843 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It was in the cellar.  Weird.
L291842 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ What is it?
L291840 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
L291839 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L291838 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Were you fooling with the power?
L291837 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The heater's here.
L291807 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Ok.
L291806 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ ...set up some more things.
L291805 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
L291804 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
L291803 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
L291798 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know.  That's strange.
L291797 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L291794 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
L291793 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L291792 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Are you playing tricks on me?
L291738 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
L291737 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ God rest her soul.
L291736 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Or what she was worth.
L291735 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
L291734 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
L291733 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I wish I knew more about her.
L291732 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ To our family.
L291731 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ To our family.
L291726 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Whatever you say.
L291725 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ It's just going to take a while.
L291724 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
L291723 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ You didn't think much about that before.
L291722 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
L291721 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
L291720 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What will Aubrey think?
L291719 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I just, I don't know...
L291718 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh come on...
L291717 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
L291716 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What's the matter?
L291712 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Must be...
L291711 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
L291710 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
L291709 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The place is pretty dusty.
L291708 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
L291707 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
L291706 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
L291692 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
L291691 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
L292037 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ White meat will be fine...
L292036 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
L292031 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ You'll have to settle for turkey.
L292030 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
L292007 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Yeah, they told us this was the best.
L292006 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Maura.
L292005 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Maura.
L292004 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
L291944 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Before.
L291943 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
L291931 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
L291930 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
L291911 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
L291910 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
L291906 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ What about the other five percent?
L291905 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
L291904 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ What do you mean, unfortunately?
L291903 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
L291902 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ I think we should do it.
L291894 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ I could see if I detect the presence of something.
L291893 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ We don't know.
L291892 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
L291891 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
L292111 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Come back to us honey!
L292110 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ She's coming back.  Keep talking!
L292106 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
L292105 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Concentrate!  She can hear you!
L292093 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Aubrey?  It's mommy.
L292092 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
L292089 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ So what should we do, father?
L292088 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
L292085 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
L292084 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Why?
L292083 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
L292062 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ What!
L292061 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Your daughter's been taken.
L291770 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
L291769 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Well it's nice that you were there for her.
L291766 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
L291765 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ It was a shame.
L291764 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
L291763 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Did you know her very well?
L291762 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
L291754 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ May I come in?
L291753 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Oh, that's nice...
L291752 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ ...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
L291748 +++$+++ u5930 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ MAURA +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L291747 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ You must be a Londrigan.
L292133 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We'll be there.
L292132 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
L292131 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes, they are.
L292130 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
L292128 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
L292127 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What's going to happen?
L292126 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I didn't do anything...God saved her...
L292125 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
L292124 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
L292123 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The rain is letting up.
L292101 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
L292100 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Keep talking!
L292087 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ It will not take long...
L292086 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How long will it take!
L292067 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
L292066 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What are you getting at!
L292065 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
L292064 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
L292063 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
L292058 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Did you remove anything in the cellar!
L292057 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What...amulet?
L292053 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ The amulet...
L292052 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ This isn't happening...
L292001 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
L292000 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We'll never know for sure.
L291785 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Good night.
L291784 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
L291782 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Perhaps I'll see you in church.
L291781 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Thank you.
L291780 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
L291779 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
L291778 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
L291768 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
L291767 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What was she afraid of?
L291745 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How can I help you?
L291744 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
L291743 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And you...are?
L291742 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ You must be the new tenants.
L291990 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
L291989 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well what is it!
L291988 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ There's something through that wall!
L291987 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L291986 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ There's something in there.
L291946 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not at all, if it can help.
L291945 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Do you mind if I borrow it?
L291942 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Runic?
L291941 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
L291940 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It was nailed to the cellar wall.
L291939 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Where did you find this?
L291937 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
L291936 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
L291929 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
L291928 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
L291927 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
L291901 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
L291900 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And what would you do?
L291899 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
L291897 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh.
L291896 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
