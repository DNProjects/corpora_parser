L244191 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ In the abstract...
L244190 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ You went for it.
L244189 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
L244188 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's none of your fucking business...
L244187 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
L244186 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's right.
L244185 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
L244184 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Then tough luck, George, because you are.
L244183 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ I didn't ask to be.
L244182 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
L244181 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ That's ridiculous.

L244178 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ ...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
L244177 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ ...I thought that we were only talking...
L244176 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ ...and rob the place...
L244175 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ ...you don't have to come in...
L244174 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
L244173 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Yes.  I'm sure.

L244170 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
L244169 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Why would I do it?
L244168 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ They're going to come to everyone.
L244167 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Why would they come to me?
L244166 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ They come to you, you going to turn me in?
L244165 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What if you don't get caught?
L244164 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
L244163 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What does that mean?
L244162 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Oh, yes, George.
L244160 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.
L244159 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
L244158 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.
L244157 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Dave.
L244156 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
L244155 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ They'll know when you go over to Graff...
L244154 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
L244153 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ I...

L244144 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
L244143 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ You have to steal the leads tonight?
L244142 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ What?  What?  The leads.
L244141 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?
L244140 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
L244138 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ He would take you on.  Yes.
L244137 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ He'd give me a job.
L244136 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Is that what I said?
L244135 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ A job with Graff.
L244134 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
L244133 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ You're saying "me."
L244132 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
L244131 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ For five thousand?
L244130 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ A buck a shot.
L244129 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What will he pay?
L244128 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.
L244126 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ What did he say?  He'd buy them.
L244125 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What did he say?
L244124 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Is that what I said?
L244123 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Did you talk to Graff?
L244122 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Did I say that?
L244120 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Have I said that?
L244119 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ You're going to steal the leads?
L244118 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's right.
L244117 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ You're actually talking about this?
L244116 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
L244115 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
L244113 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ We are?
L244112 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
L244111 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ What did you say?

L244109 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ No.  Not actually.
L244108 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ You didn't?
L244107 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Not actually, no.
L244106 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
L244105 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Hey.
L244104 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Well.  Well...
L244103 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ As a "robbery"?!  No.
L244102 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ As a robbery.
L244101 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ No.
L244100 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Talking about it as a...

L244095 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
L244094 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ We're just "talking" about it.
L244093 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ No, we're just...
L244092 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
L244091 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
L244090 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ You haven't talked to him.
L244089 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Graff?  Because I worked for him.
L244088 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ How do you know he'd buy them?
L244087 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.
L244086 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
L244085 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
L244084 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ How many leads have we got?
L244083 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
L244082 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What could somebody get for them?
L244081 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
L244080 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Huh.
L244079 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Someone should rob the office.
L244078 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What? 
L244077 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.

L244067 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Someone should stand up and strike back.
L244066 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?
L244065 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ I want to tell you what somebody should do.
L244064 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?

L244050 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Huh.
L244049 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
L244048 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ That's the truth...
L244047 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
L244046 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ That's right...
L244045 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
L244044 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What act?
L244043 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Just the act.
L244042 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?
L244041 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?

L244039 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Starting up.
L244038 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?

L244036 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ No, it's not that simple, Dave...
L244035 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
L244034 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
L244033 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
L244032 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Himself?
L244031 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
L244030 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ With River Oaks?
L244029 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
L244028 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Yes.
L244027 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ The nurses?
L244026 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ I heard that they were running cold.
L244025 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ He's doing very well.
L244024 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ He is?
L244023 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...

L244606 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
L244383 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...

L244257 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
L244247 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.

L244226 +++$+++ u5523 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ BAYLEN +++$+++ Excuse me, sir...
L244225 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?

L244793 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Because I don't like you.
L244792 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Why?
L244791 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L244790 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Don't.
L244788 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You did?
L244787 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Call up the bank.  I called them.
L244786 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
L244785 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
L244784 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ The check's no good?
L244783 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
L244782 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I've got the check...
L244781 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
L244780 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Abso...
L244779 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Only the beginning...
L244778 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
L244777 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What sales?
L244776 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
L244775 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
L244774 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I...
L244773 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ No, I don't think so, Shel.
L244772 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
L244770 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
L244769 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What?
L244768 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
L244767 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
L244766 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Mmm.
L244765 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ He told me my share was twenty-five.
L244764 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L244763 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
L244762 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Was it?
L244761 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ It was his idea.
L244760 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ That was easy, wasn't it?
L244759 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
L244758 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Who kept the other half?
L244757 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Five thousand.  I kept half.
L244756 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
L244755 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I sold them to Jerry Graff.
L244753 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I...
L244752 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
L244751 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I don't know what you are saying.
L244750 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
L244749 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
L244748 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You robbed the office.
L244747 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You're so full of shit.
L244746 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
L244745 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
L244744 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ No.  It hadn't.
L244743 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Well, hadn't it?
L244742 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
L244741 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L244740 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
L244739 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L244738 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ How do you know I made it up?
L244737 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What?
L244736 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ How do you know I made it up?
L244733 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
L244732 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Excuse me...
L244731 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
L244730 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Why I don't...
L244729 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
L244728 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What are you trying to tell me?
L244727 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L244726 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You are?
L244725 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
L244724 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Mmm.
L244723 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
L244722 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Yes.  I hear you.
L244721 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
L244720 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Mmm.
L244496 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
L244495 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ It's not impossible.
L244494 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
L244493 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.
L244492 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
L244491 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
L244490 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What does that fucking mean?
L244489 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
L244488 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
L244487 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
L244486 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
L244485 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
L244484 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Did you tell 'em my sale?
L244483 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
L244482 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Get 'em to me!
L244481 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ The leads are coming.
L244480 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
L244370 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Somebody broke in.
L244369 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What happened?
L243951 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ The deal still stands, our other thing.
L243950 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ That's alright.
L243949 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
L243948 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Is that what you're saying?
L243947 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah.
L243946 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You want something off the B list?
L243945 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
L243944 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
L243943 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Because I say so.
L243942 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Why?
L243941 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I can't split them.
L243940 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.

L243938 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
L243937 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I can't do it, Shelly...
L243936 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
L243935 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ No.

L243933 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Can't do it.
L243932 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
L243931 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I wish I could.
L243929 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Now.  Yes...When?

L243926 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Good.  Now we're talking.
L243925 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Alright.
L243924 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
L243923 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
L243922 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I saw the board.  You've got four...
L243921 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I'm not sure I have two.
L243920 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
L243919 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What are we going to say?
L243918 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
L243917 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ And fifty bucks a lead.
L243916 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Alright.
L243915 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Twenty percent.
L243914 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
L243913 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Not lately you can't...
L243912 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
L243911 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
L243910 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I will close.
L243909 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What if you don't close...?
L243908 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I will close.
L243907 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ And what if you don't close.
L243906 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Of what?
L243904 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I can't do it, Shel.
L243903 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
L243902 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
L243901 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Then put me on the board.
L243900 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...apart from the top men on the contest board.
L243899 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
L243898 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ The leads are assigned randomly...
L243897 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Why?
L243895 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
L243894 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...they kicked out.
L243893 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
L243892 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
L243891 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Yes.
L243890 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I'm out.
L243889 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Either way.  You're out.
L243888 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
L243887 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
L243886 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...ah, fuck this...
L243885 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
L243884 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ John.  John...
L243883 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Murray said...
L243882 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
L243881 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
L243880 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Murray said...
L243879 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
L243878 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You know what those leads cost?
L243877 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
L243876 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
L243875 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes.
L243874 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...let me...are you listening to me...?
L243873 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
L243872 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Let me...
L243871 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
L243870 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You're saying that I'm fucked.
L243869 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
L243868 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
L243867 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...you talk to Murray...
L243866 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Murray...
L243865 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
L243864 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...after the thirtieth...
L243863 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
L243862 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ It isn't me...
L243861 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
L243860 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Not lately it isn't.
L243859 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
L243858 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Moss.
L243857 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Under him?

L243854 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ All that I'm saying...
L243853 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
L243852 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...I only...

L243846 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
L243845 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What two?
L243844 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What about the other two?
L243843 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
L243842 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Shelly...

We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...

You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
L244501 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ That's right, Shel.
L244500 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
L244499 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ ...yes...
L244498 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
L244497 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ You closed 'em today?
L244477 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: "Now is the time."  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together. 
L244476 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Like you taught me...
L244475 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
L244474 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
L244473 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Harriett...
L244472 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
L244471 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ "Always be closing..."
L244470 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ "What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
L244469 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Fuck her...
L244468 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ From the store.
L244467 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ How was it...?

L244430 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Fuck you care...?
L244417 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ "You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
L244416 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Fuck you, Dave...

Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.

It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
L244558 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ My wife said I have to cancel the deal.

L244217 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
L244216 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ Gimlet.
L244215 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
L244213 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
L244212 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ Mmmm...
L244211 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Yes.

L244209 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
L244208 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ I don't know.

You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?

L244449 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
