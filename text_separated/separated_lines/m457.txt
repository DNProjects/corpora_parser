L410761 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
L410760 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
L410758 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Don't play with me.
L410757 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
L410756 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Take this off.
L410754 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Then we would have talked, you and I.
L410753 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ No. I only needed the code from you.
L410752 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
L410621 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Of course.
L410620 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
L410619 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
L410618 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Let me get you another glass of wine.
L410616 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ I'm fine.
L410615 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
L410796 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Of course...
L410795 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ What about her?
L410794 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
L410793 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ You're hurt...
L410742 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
L410741 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
L410733 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
L410732 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
L410782 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
L410781 +++$+++ u6842 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ AEROL +++$+++ Ghost a steppin' razor...
L410747 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410746 +++$+++ u6842 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ AEROL +++$+++ What you lookin' for, mon?
L410728 +++$+++ u6842 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ AEROL +++$+++ Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
L410727 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L410717 +++$+++ u6842 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ AEROL +++$+++ Straylight. Kitchen dock.
L410716 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
L410672 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
L410671 +++$+++ u6842 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ AEROL +++$+++ Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
L410670 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Can you get us into Straylight?
L410565 +++$+++ u6842 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ AEROL +++$+++ The Elders, mon...
L410564 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What are you doing in here?
L410543 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
L410542 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ How's the villa's security?
L410541 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
L410534 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
L410533 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
L410476 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
L410475 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
L410234 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
L410233 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What's an A.I.
L410229 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
L410228 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Easy...
L410547 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ And how do you suggest I do that?
L410546 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
L410518 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ What?
L410517 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
L410516 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
L410510 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
L410509 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
L410508 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
L410502 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Why not?
L410501 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Alright. Let's talk business.
L410607 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I find out now.
L410606 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
L410600 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ This ain't Bangkok, chief.
L410599 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ You've got your orders.
L410597 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
L410596 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L410595 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
L410594 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
L410593 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
L410538 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
L410537 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
L410474 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
L410473 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
L410472 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
L410471 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
L410470 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
L410469 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ You see the couple up in the balcony?
L410468 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
L410356 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
L410355 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Yeah, well it's working.
L410349 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Linked?
L410348 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ You'll be linked during the entire operation.
L410347 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
L410346 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
L410345 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
L410344 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Prepping your trip.
L410343 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
L410342 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ What about McCoy?
L410341 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
L410340 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ No, but it traced me.
L410339 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Did you trace it?
L410338 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
L410337 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ What's this?
L410333 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What's he doing to my gear?
L410332 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
L410331 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
L410330 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ You ran without us.
L410251 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
L410250 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
L410249 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ And then?
L410248 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
L410247 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
L410246 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
L410245 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L410244 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
L410243 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
L410242 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ I've arranged for him to work with us.
L410241 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
L410240 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Dixie McCoy
L410239 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
L410238 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ It hasn't yet.
L410237 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
L410236 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
L410235 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
L410232 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
L410231 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
L410230 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Why'd you do it, Armitage?
L410227 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ You son of a bitch...
L410226 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
L410225 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Good, because you've got a new one.
L410224 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
L410223 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
L410222 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
L410221 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
L410177 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
L410176 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
L410175 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
L410174 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
L410173 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
L410172 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
L410171 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'd say you were full of shit.
L410170 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
L410169 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
L410168 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
L410167 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
L410166 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
L410165 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
L410164 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What does this have to do with me?
L410163 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
L410160 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Very well.
L410159 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
L410158 +++$+++ u6843 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ ARMITAGE +++$+++ Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
L410712 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
L410711 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
L410710 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
L410709 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
L410708 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
L410707 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The access code to your mainframe.
L410706 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ The words?
L410705 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Tell me the words.
L410703 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
L410702 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Are you even really alive?
L410701 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
L410698 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
L410697 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Can you read my mind?
L410696 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
L410695 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
L410694 +++$+++ u6844 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ BAO/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ An odd selection, Mr Case.
L410105 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Yeah.
L410104 +++$+++ u6852 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RATZ +++$+++ Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
L410103 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ You're pleasant tonight.
L410102 +++$+++ u6852 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RATZ +++$+++ Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
L410101 +++$+++ u6852 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RATZ +++$+++ No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
L410100 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I don't have a girl.
L410099 +++$+++ u6852 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RATZ +++$+++ I saw your girl yesterday.
L410095 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
L410094 +++$+++ u6852 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RATZ +++$+++ Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
L410306 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
L410305 +++$+++ u6850 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
L410304 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
L410303 +++$+++ u6850 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
L410302 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
L410301 +++$+++ u6850 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
L410300 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
L410299 +++$+++ u6850 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
L410298 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Yeah. That was me.
L410297 +++$+++ u6850 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
L410296 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Fine, Dixie. Fine.
L410295 +++$+++ u6850 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
L410294 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ It's Case. Remember me?
L410293 +++$+++ u6850 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Hey, bro.
L410906 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Maybe so...
L410905 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ Jah guides us.
L410904 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
L410902 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
L410901 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
L410900 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
L410895 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
L410894 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Ready?
L410890 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Can you walk?
L410889 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ Four men. Babylon soldiers.
L410787 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The girl 3Jane. We need her.
L410786 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
L410766 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ This place empty as a tomb, mon.
L410765 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ We're doing fine. Take the next right.
L410674 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I an' I, man. I an' I.
L410673 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
L410613 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
L410612 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ All things possible in Babylon.
L410611 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
L410610 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
L410609 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ She's ready to go.
L410572 +++$+++ u6849 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MAELCOM +++$+++ Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
L410571 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What elders?
L410858 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
L410857 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What about the route to the core?
L410848 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
L410847 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
L410846 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
L410845 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
L410844 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ You haven't got it?
L410843 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ It's coming.
L410842 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
L410841 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How's the ice?
L410840 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ You're late.
L410779 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
L410778 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
L410777 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
L410776 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Less than thirty minutes.
L410775 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ How much time you got left?
L410774 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
L410773 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
L410772 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How long, Dixie?
L410771 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
L410770 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
L410769 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How's the ice break?
L410768 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Yo.
L410685 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
L410684 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ It'll flatline your ass.
L410682 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
L410681 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
L410680 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ You can make your move when it comes after me.
L410679 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
L410678 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ We run. You crack the pattern?
L410677 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
L410676 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ We got problems topside.
L410675 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Where the hell have you been?
L410562 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
L410561 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
L410560 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
L410559 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
L410558 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
L410557 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
L410556 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
L410555 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
L410554 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
L410553 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
L410552 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Bright enough to be dangerous.
L410551 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
L410550 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
L410431 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
L410430 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
L410429 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
L410428 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
L410427 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Can you take me to it?
L410426 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
L410425 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How are we doing?
L410424 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Yo.
L410383 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
L410382 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What?
L410381 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
L410380 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
L410379 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ No problem, amigo.
L410378 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
L410377 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Nobody has.
L410376 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Never heard of him.
L410375 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ A guy who calls himself Armitage.
L410374 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Who got you into this?
L410373 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
L410372 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
L410316 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What?
L410315 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
L410314 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
L410313 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
L410312 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Right...
L410311 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
L410810 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ No!... No...
L410809 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Want to fucking answer them?
L410807 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The angels... I think they're calling your name.
L410806 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ What?
L410805 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Wait... You hear that?
L410545 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ 3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
L410544 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What about the mainframe's access code?
L410498 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
L410497 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Case.
L410496 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
L410877 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I don't know. I don't know...
L410876 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ Case... are you okay?
L410114 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
L410113 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Where did you here that?
L410112 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
L410111 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
L410110 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
L410109 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
L410108 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
L410107 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I thought you already left.
L410106 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ Hello, Case.
L410455 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
L410454 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
L410452 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
L410451 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I think you're full of shit.
L410450 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
L410449 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Why would you want me to kill you?
L410448 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
L410447 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
L410446 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
L410445 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
L410444 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
L410443 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ And Linda...
L410442 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ I had to limit your options.
L410441 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
L410440 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ And we really do have to talk.
L410439 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
L410438 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I know who you are.
L410831 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Hold on.
L410830 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm still going in.
L410829 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You're out of time, man.
L410828 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
L410827 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What is it?
L410826 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Shit...
L410821 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
L410820 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ My God... these people are insane.
L410818 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ No we don't...
L410817 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ We've still got to find the mainframe.
L410816 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410815 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ ...And if I guess wrong?
L410814 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
L410812 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
L410811 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Is he going to make it?
L410530 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
L410529 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
L410528 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I know you have. C'mere.
L410527 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
L410525 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What went down between you and Riviera?
L410524 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I know.
L410483 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ For Peter, that's a short trip.
L410482 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
L410481 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ He projects with neural implants.
L410466 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
L410465 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Something exotic I hope.
L410464 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
L410460 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ So... did you get a look at heaven?
L410459 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'll be okay.
L410458 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
L410457 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
L410456 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Case... Are you alright?
L410418 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
L410417 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What's wrong? Don't like flying?
L410410 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Give me five minutes.
L410409 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Yeah... fine.
L410407 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ They'll cut you down.
L410406 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I'll get the car.
L410402 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L410401 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I don't sleep much. You packed?
L410400 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Case... it's four a.m.
L410396 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Shhh...
L410395 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Case...
L410394 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ ...Feels like you.
L410393 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Put the gun down, Case.
L410392 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ It sounds like you.
L410391 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
L410390 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
L410325 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ ...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
L410324 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You okay?
L410273 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
L410272 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
L410271 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Dixie McCoy didn't.
L410270 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
L410269 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Won't that mean you're dead?
L410268 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
L410266 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
L410265 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Too late?
L410264 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
L410263 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ A regular Fagan.
L410262 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
L410261 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ So you're a wire junkie.
L410260 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ On a good run... yeah.
L410259 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
L410258 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
L410257 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
L410256 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
L410255 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You're not ready yet. They said two days.
L410254 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm going in.
L410217 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Go ahead...
L410216 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What the fuck... are you serious?
L410215 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
L410214 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
L410213 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ That's not going to help.
L410212 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Couple of days. They'll examine you.
L410211 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How soon is soon enough?
L410210 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
L410209 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I gotta know... did it work>
L410208 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Almost two days.
L410207 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How long have I been out?
L410206 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
L410205 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Holy shit...
L410199 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What?
L410198 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You've been calling her name.
L410189 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L410188 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Maybe something's onto him.
L410187 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
L410186 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
L410185 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
L410184 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What about before that?
L410183 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Couple of months.
L410182 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
L410181 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
L410180 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
L410150 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
L410149 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
L410148 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ ... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
L410147 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What is it?
L410145 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
L410144 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What's my end?
L410143 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
L410142 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Why should I want to meet him.
L410141 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
L410851 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Shut up.
L410850 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ What the fuck kind of questions are those?
L410835 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L410834 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ How are you at riddles, Peter?
L410833 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ What?
L410832 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Get up.
L410739 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
L410738 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Like what?
L410737 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
L410736 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Who?
L410735 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
L410734 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Peter... What do you think you're doing?
