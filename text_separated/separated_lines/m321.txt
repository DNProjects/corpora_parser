L161697 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
L161292 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Wade's here.
L161291 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Yeah?
L161220 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I want this bastard brought down.
L161219 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
L161218 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
L161217 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
L161216 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ That's him.  Simon Doucet.
L161206 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I can smell it.
L161205 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
L161204 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Technothugs?
L161203 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
L161202 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What'cha got, Bennett?
L161201 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
L161695 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
L161694 +++$+++ u4814 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ CASSY +++$+++ Kimberly!
L161693 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I think he wants more than your cookies.
L161692 +++$+++ u4814 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ CASSY +++$+++ He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
L161691 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
L161690 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I'd think about it.
L161689 +++$+++ u4814 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ CASSY +++$+++ What did you say?
L161688 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
L161892 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Put that on your political resume.
L161891 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
L161856 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
L161855 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
L161854 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
L161853 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Speak up.
L161846 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ Your mother.
L161845 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
L161844 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ Fuck you - fuck you.
L161843 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Funny guy.
L161842 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
L161841 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I want to ask you a few questions.
L161840 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
L161839 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ My man Dubbs.
L161838 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Avon Lady!
L161837 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ Who is it?
L161888 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
L161887 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I don't want to hear anymore.
L161886 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ <u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
L161885 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You're crazy.
L161884 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
L161883 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L161882 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That wasn't your plan, was it?
L161881 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
L161880 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We have to talk.
L161879 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What is it?  I'm about to go on.
L161774 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Not anymore.
L161773 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
L161772 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm wasting time.
L161768 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where?
L161767 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
L161598 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
L161597 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
L161596 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Remember my promise.
L161595 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
L161591 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ And I want Doucet.
L161590 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I want to stop aging.
L161589 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
L161588 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not voting for you.
L161587 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
L161585 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I'll be alright.
L161584 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
L161583 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Out of the room.
L161582 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Hello Wade.
L161326 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
L161325 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You're working a partner on this.
L161324 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
L161323 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
L161318 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ When you bring in Doucet.
L161317 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Give it to me.
L161316 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
L161315 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
L161314 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
L161313 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
L161312 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
L161311 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
L161310 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Mug sheets.
L161309 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
L161308 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What's this?
L161306 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
L161305 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
L161304 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Later.  I want Doucet first.
L161303 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I want to see my wife and kid.
L161302 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
L161301 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not on the force anymore.
L161300 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
L161299 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
L161298 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
L161297 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
L161296 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
L161295 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
L161890 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
L161889 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
L161412 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L161411 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Sir, your transmission's fading.
L161408 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I'm thrilled beyond belief.
L161407 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
L161406 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
L161374 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Forget it.  Stick to the program.
L161373 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
L161372 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
L161237 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
L161236 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Kill him... kill him.
L161233 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ He could be brought back.
L161232 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
L161230 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
L161229 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
L161162 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
L161161 +++$+++ u4822 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
L161160 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Just great.
L161159 +++$+++ u4822 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Telephone repairman.
L161158 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
L161157 +++$+++ u4822 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
L161156 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
L161894 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Shut up!  Drop it.
L161893 +++$+++ u4818 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ PEEBLES +++$+++ Sir---
L161615 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Keep 'em busy.
L161614 +++$+++ u4818 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ PEEBLES +++$+++ Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
L161601 +++$+++ u4818 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ PEEBLES +++$+++ Aces.
L161600 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ How do I look?
L161599 +++$+++ u4818 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ PEEBLES +++$+++ You okay?
L161594 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
L161593 +++$+++ u4818 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ PEEBLES +++$+++ Sir, your limo's here.
L161578 +++$+++ u4818 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ PEEBLES +++$+++ I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
L161577 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Fine.
L161576 +++$+++ u4818 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ PEEBLES +++$+++ Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
L161668 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Ooops, I forgot.
L161667 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Not the 'T' word.
L161666 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Maybe I should put on the training whe---
L161665 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Go in the house.
L161664 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Nobody's looking.
L161663 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
L161662 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ You sure?  I can help you.
L161661 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ I got it.  I got it.
L161660 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Need help?
L161864 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ And you should be with your family.
L161863 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You should be in hospital.
L161783 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No you don't.
L161782 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ No.  I want to be with you.
L161781 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm signing off.
L161780 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You be careful.
L161779 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
L161778 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I just heard.
L161736 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
L161735 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
L161729 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Hospital food.
L161728 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
L161727 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
L161726 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You okay?
L161725 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
L161724 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
L161723 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
L161722 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L161658 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Not yet.
L161657 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ ...Have you been drinking?
L161656 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
L161655 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ ...What are you talking about...?
L161654 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You treat her nice.
L161653 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I'm here.
L161652 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Sanchez...?
L161632 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We're partners, aren't we?
L161631 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ What's this?
L161629 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Not too good.
L161628 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ How do I look?
L161627 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How ya feeling?
L161626 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Rip Van Winkle.
L161541 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ <u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
L161540 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
L161538 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Simulated one.
L161537 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
L161525 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
L161524 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Wallet, cash, I.D...
L161523 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What else did he get?
L161522 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
L161518 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ No, sir.
L161517 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You're not pregnant, are you?
L161516 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
L161515 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Wanna try?
L161508 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
L161507 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
L161506 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
L161505 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
L161504 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
L161500 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
L161499 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Maybe I should turn myself in.
L161497 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ That cost me two weeks' pay.
L161496 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
L161493 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Then find me some cigarettes.
L161492 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L161491 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You want to be a good detective?
L161490 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
L161489 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Hey, I'm eating.
L161488 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
L161487 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
L161484 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
L161483 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'll have a cup of coffee?
L161474 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Good night.
L161473 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Good night, Wade.
L161472 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'll be okay.
L161471 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You need anything else?
L161467 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Thanks.
L161466 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ She's pretty.
L161465 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
L161464 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L161462 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
L161461 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ What's this place?
L161459 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
L161458 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
L161457 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Married?
L161456 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
L161455 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
L161454 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ 'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
L161453 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
L161452 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I was set up.
L161451 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Why?
L161450 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Drop it.
L161449 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
L161448 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
L161447 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
L161446 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
L161445 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ How then?
L161444 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You can't catch this man with a computer.
L161443 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
L161438 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Relax, let technology do the work.
L161437 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Hey, buddy...
L161435 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Trust me.  You don't want to know.
L161434 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
L161433 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Bacon cheeseburgers.
L161432 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
L161431 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
L161430 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yes.
L161429 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
L161428 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Pass.
L161427 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
L161378 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ My insurance won't cover it.
L161377 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Wanna come?
L161376 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not fond of television comedies.
L161375 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
L161368 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
L161367 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
L161366 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
L161365 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I'll inform dispatch.
L161364 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Some things never change.
L161363 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ How do you know?
L161362 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ They're going to rob that bank.
L161359 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Technothugs.
L161358 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ See those guys?
L161355 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Doucet killed my partner.
L161354 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
L161353 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
L161352 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I have to go home, Sanchez.
L161350 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lean year for role models.
L161349 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
L161348 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Got it.  Ejection seat?
L161347 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
L161346 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Does it drive itself, too?
L161344 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
L161343 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ But Sergeant...
L161342 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm ready.
L161341 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
L161340 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I drive.
L161339 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, that's good enough for me.
L161338 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Yes.
L161337 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Are you a cop?
L161336 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
L161335 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You my partner?
L161190 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
L161189 +++$+++ u4820 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SHEPPARD +++$+++ They always are.
L161188 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ But he was such a good cop.
L161187 +++$+++ u4820 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SHEPPARD +++$+++ He went dirty and they made an example of him.
L161186 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
L161185 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Take a look at this.
L161184 +++$+++ u4820 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SHEPPARD +++$+++ You never want to find out.
L161183 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ What's it mean?
L161182 +++$+++ u4820 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SHEPPARD +++$+++ Demolition Man.
L161181 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
L161180 +++$+++ u4820 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SHEPPARD +++$+++ You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
L161179 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ This is the guy that killed my partner.
L161178 +++$+++ u4820 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SHEPPARD +++$+++ Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
L161687 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Remember, get the seat fixed.
L161686 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Bye.  Thanks.
L161684 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Good to know you, Willy.
L161683 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ William Simpson.  I like Willy.
L161682 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What's your name?
L161681 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ I'm going to be a policeman.
L161680 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ My granddad was a policeman.
L161679 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yes.
L161677 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ My mom says I'm gonna grow.
L161676 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Seat's too high.
L161675 +++$+++ u4824 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L161674 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You all right?
L161716 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
L161715 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
L161714 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
L161713 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ You could always take it off.
L161712 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This little thing says I can't.
L161711 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
L161709 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
L161708 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Hi.
L161707 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ Hi.
