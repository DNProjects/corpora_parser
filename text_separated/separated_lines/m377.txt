L259254 +++$+++ u5687 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT BOB +++$+++ It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
L259253 +++$+++ u5688 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT RAY +++$+++ It's cool!
L259252 +++$+++ u5687 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT BOB +++$+++ You think it's cool?
L259251 +++$+++ u5688 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT RAY +++$+++ Yeah, cool.
L259250 +++$+++ u5687 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT BOB +++$+++ Cool?
L259249 +++$+++ u5688 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT RAY +++$+++ Now that's cool.
L259248 +++$+++ u5687 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT BOB +++$+++ Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
L259193 +++$+++ u5688 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT RAY +++$+++ Alright sir.
L259192 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
L259191 +++$+++ u5688 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT RAY +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
L259190 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
L259189 +++$+++ u5688 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ AGENT RAY +++$+++ It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
L259188 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ How's it going, Ray?
L259572 +++$+++ u5689 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ How are you going to take care of the cops?
L259571 +++$+++ u5704 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ RAZOR +++$+++ Hackers of the World, Unite!
L259570 +++$+++ u5689 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
L259567 +++$+++ u5689 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
L259566 +++$+++ u5704 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ RAZOR +++$+++ She's rabid, but cute.
L259562 +++$+++ u5704 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ RAZOR +++$+++ Waste the dude.
L259561 +++$+++ u5689 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ Let's keep her.
L259180 +++$+++ u5689 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
L259179 +++$+++ u5704 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ RAZOR +++$+++ ...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
L259178 +++$+++ u5689 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
L259177 +++$+++ u5704 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ RAZOR +++$+++ Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
L259176 +++$+++ u5689 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
L259167 +++$+++ u5689 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ Hack the Planet!
L259166 +++$+++ u5704 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ RAZOR +++$+++ Welcome to our show!
L259541 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
L259540 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ What?
L259444 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
L259443 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
L259331 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ The sensitive type.
L259330 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Right.
L259317 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Was that her top?
L259316 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Shh!
L259315 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Shit!
L259256 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ What is it with this guy?
L259255 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
L259115 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
L259114 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
L259100 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
L259099 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Oh yeah? What's that?
L259098 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Dragon book. Compiler design.
L259097 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ What's that?
L259096 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Devil book. The Unix Bible.
L259095 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ What's that?
L259547 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
L259546 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Damn!
L259539 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
L259538 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
L259533 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ ...as they snoop onto us.
L259532 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Snoop onto them...
L259517 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Yo, brain dead, the manual!
L259516 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Ta-da!
L259497 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
L259496 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ That's far out!
L259495 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
L259491 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
L259490 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
L259468 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Looks like a hacker wrote it.
L259467 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
L259466 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Hold on a second!
L259397 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Super hero like even.
L259396 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Very impressive.
L259311 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ I want it.

L259158 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
L259319 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Difficulty rating?
L259318 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ One-handed!
L259314 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Yo, hit the lights.
L259313 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
L259312 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ I want it to have my children!
L259259 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
L259258 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
L259257 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
L259122 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ I'm gonna hit you!
L259121 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
L259120 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ It was him, man!
L259119 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
L259113 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
L259112 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
L259111 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
L259110 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
L259106 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
L259105 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
L259085 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
L259084 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ ...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
L259581 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Roger.
L259580 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Go fix the phones.
L259579 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Yeah?
L259578 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Cereal.
L259577 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
L259545 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
L259544 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Well this hasn't happened yet.
L259507 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
L259506 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
L259505 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Oh wow, we are fried.
L259442 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
L259441 +++$+++ u5690 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ CEREAL +++$+++ Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
L259401 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
L259400 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
L259395 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
L259394 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Dead?
L259393 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Dead.
L259309 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah? Display?
L259308 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
L259261 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
L259260 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Did you talk to him?
L259149 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
L259148 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
L259048 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
L259047 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ And what's he do?
L259046 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Curtis.
L259045 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Who's that?
L259082 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ And unpack.
L259081 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
L259079 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?
L259078 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ No. No one special.
L259077 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
L259076 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Revenge.
L259075 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ What did we learn in school today?
L259074 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Hmmm.
L259073 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ How was school?
L258987 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
L258986 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
L258985 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
L258984 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
L258983 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
L258982 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ Up all night again, huh?
L258981 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Mm-hmm.
L258980 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
L258954 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
L258953 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I'm taking over a TV network.
L258952 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L258951 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah, mom?
L258950 +++$+++ u5698 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MRS. MURPHY +++$+++ Dade?
L259618 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
L259617 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I found it! I found it!
L259608 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Give it up! Just give it up.
L259607 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
L259606 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
L259462 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
L259461 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
L259460 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Talk to me.
L259459 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
L259458 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
L259457 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
L259456 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ That's bullshit.
L259455 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
L259454 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
L259453 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I told you, I don't play well with others.
L259452 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
L259292 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Thank you!
L259291 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Blow me.
L259290 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
L259288 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
L259287 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Shit! Come on!
L259286 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Nah. I don't play well with others.
L259285 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
L259284 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I'm sorry. Who are you?
L259283 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
L259636 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ We did it!
L259635 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Yes!
L259620 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ Joey's getting stupid busy.
L259619 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Oh, shit! He got me.
L259509 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Okay. Let's go shopping.

L259474 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ It nibbles. You see this?
L259473 +++$+++ u5699 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NIKON +++$+++ What's this one eat?
L259472 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ This isn't a virus. It's a worm!

L259686 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
L259685 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
L259684 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I can't believe they decided you won.
L259683 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Wanna go for a swim?
L259682 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You would have looked better.

L259650 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I'm trying to help you.
L259649 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Are you crazy? What are you doing?
L259604 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
L259603 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
L259587 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Alright, let's boot up.
L259586 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L259585 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Ready?
L259565 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
L259564 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
L259563 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
L259553 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ They're elite! Let's get 'em.
L259552 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
L259551 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ There they are!
L259537 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
L259536 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Alright, so what have we got?
L259514 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It's my subway defense system.
L259513 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Shit!!
L259501 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I'll hack the Gibson.
L259500 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ How?
L259499 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I'll make it up to you!
L259498 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Well that's great. There goes MIT.
L259493 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
L259492 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Why did he come to you?
L259489 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I didn't know what was on it.
L259488 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You what?
L259487 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
L259486 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What?
L259485 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I know, I know who wrote it.
L259484 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
L259480 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
L259479 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
L259478 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
L259477 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
L259476 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
L259475 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
L259465 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I have to tell you something.
L259464 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Uh, hold on...
L259463 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Kate, listen.
L259451 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Okay, thank you.
L259450 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Okay. I'll copy it.
L259449 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Thank you.
L259447 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
L259446 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I can't.
L259445 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
L259440 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Do my ears deceive me?
L259439 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ We need your help.
L259370 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
L259369 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ And you have to smile.
L259368 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You're not gonna win.
L259367 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Make it our first date.
L259366 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Make it my first born.
L259365 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ And if I win?
L259364 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
L259363 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Your slave?
L259362 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ If I win, you become my slave.
L259361 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Name your stakes.
L259360 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Are you challenging me?
L259359 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L259358 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
L259357 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
L259356 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah. RISC is good.
L259355 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
L259354 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
L259353 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
L259352 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ It has a killer refresh rate.
L259350 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah?
L259349 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It's too much machine for you.
L259348 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ It's cool, I'm just looking.
L259347 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L259337 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
L259336 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I'm Crash Override.
L259335 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What?
L259334 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
L259065 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ He's not enrolled in this class.
L259064 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I said give me time.
L259063 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ He's not in this class.
L259053 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Pool on the roof must have a leak.
L259052 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What the hell is going on?
L259038 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ I'll give it a shot.
L259037 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Think you can do better?
L259036 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ That's a nice score for a girl.
L259013 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Yeah! Sure.

L258959 +++$+++ u5700 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Uhhh.. ahahaha...
L258958 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
L258957 +++$+++ u5700 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
L258956 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
L258955 +++$+++ u5700 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
L259020 +++$+++ u5696 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
L259019 +++$+++ u5691 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ DADE +++$+++ Homicidal?

L258993 +++$+++ u5696 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

L259644 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Good.
L259643 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ We caught 'em.
L259642 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Hello?
L259282 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Gill.
L259281 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
L259280 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
L259279 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
L259267 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ I think we've got something.
L259266 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Gill.
L259246 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
L259245 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
L259244 +++$+++ u5692 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
L259614 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
L259613 +++$+++ u5693 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ The System Command Processor, it's the brain.

L259602 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Cancer?
L259601 +++$+++ u5693 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
L259593 +++$+++ u5693 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
L259592 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What's happening?
L259591 +++$+++ u5693 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ There's a new virus in the database.

L259595 +++$+++ u5693 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.

L259132 +++$+++ u5693 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
L259131 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Never fear. I is here.
L259128 +++$+++ u5693 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.

L259415 +++$+++ u5694 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
L259414 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
L259413 +++$+++ u5694 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
L259412 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.

L259108 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
L259107 +++$+++ u5694 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
L259087 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ D'you bring those Crayola books?
L259086 +++$+++ u5694 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...

L259027 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
L259026 +++$+++ u5694 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
L259025 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...

L259436 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
L259435 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You think they're going to bust us?
L259434 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
L259433 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Phreak?
L259432 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Hey, it's me.
L259431 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Hello?
L259377 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
L259376 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Any questions?
L259333 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
L259332 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What is he doing in here?
L259324 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
L259323 +++$+++ u5695 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
L259600 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
L259599 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Send a Flu-shot.
L259590 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ "Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
L259589 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
L259588 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What is it? What's wrong?
L259527 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
L259526 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
L259525 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
L259524 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You said the worm was untreaceable!
L259523 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
L259522 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
L259346 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
L259345 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ So?
L259344 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
L259343 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Congratulations.
L259342 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
L259341 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Pervert! What are you talking about?
L259340 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
L259339 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Murphy kid turn you down?
L259239 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Sh, sh sh sh sh.
L259238 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
L259237 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
L259236 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
L259235 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
L259234 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I don't want to go to jail for this.
L259233 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
L259232 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What?
L259231 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
L259230 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What the hell was that all about?
L259219 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
L259218 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ So what are we supposed to do?
L259212 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What, it left a note?
L259211 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
L259210 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Excuse me?
L259209 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
L259208 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Virus?
L259207 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ A hacker planted the virus.
L259206 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
L259205 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
L259204 +++$+++ u5703 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PLAGUE +++$+++ Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
L259203 +++$+++ u5697 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
L259430 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Thank you.
L259429 +++$+++ u5701 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Just one moment.
L259428 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ 555-4202.
L259427 +++$+++ u5701 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ What number please?
L259426 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
L259425 +++$+++ u5701 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Hello, operator services.
L259035 +++$+++ u5702 +++$+++ m377 +++$+++ PHREAK +++$+++ Nonono, thank YOU!
