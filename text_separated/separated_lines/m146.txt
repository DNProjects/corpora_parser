L413246 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ You sent my assistant on an errand.
L413245 +++$+++ u2268 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ BRENDAN GRANT +++$+++ Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
L413244 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
L413243 +++$+++ u2268 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ BRENDAN GRANT +++$+++ That's my girl.
L413242 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ All right, I'll do it.
L413241 +++$+++ u2268 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ BRENDAN GRANT +++$+++ Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
L413240 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
L413238 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Nothing. I broke a lamp.
L413237 +++$+++ u2268 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ BRENDAN GRANT +++$+++ What happened here?
L413236 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Don't remind me.
L413233 +++$+++ u2268 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ BRENDAN GRANT +++$+++ Who, him? Just visiting.
L413232 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ What's he doing here?
L413231 +++$+++ u2268 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ BRENDAN GRANT +++$+++ During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
L413226 +++$+++ u2268 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ BRENDAN GRANT +++$+++ It's an important speech.
L413225 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
L412740 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L412739 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
L412737 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ The grave. Somebody close?
L412736 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What?
L412735 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Somebody close?
L412734 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Aw, too bad.
L412733 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
L412732 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
L412731 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Huh?
L412730 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ 'S okay. What do you think?
L412729 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Sorry.
L412728 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
L412727 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ San Diego.
L412726 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Where'd you come from?
L412725 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Business.
L412724 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Business or pleasure?
L412723 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Uh, yes..
L412722 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ You just come in on Amtrack?
L412721 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What?
L412720 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Amtrack?
L412719 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
L412718 +++$+++ u2269 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ CABBIE +++$+++ Where to, sir?
L413322 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Same to you.
L413321 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Good luck.
L413320 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
L413319 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
L413318 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Can we go now?
L413313 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
L413312 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ For not believing you.
L413311 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ For what?
L413310 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ I would also like to apologize.
L413309 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
L413202 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Indeed.
L413201 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ This? I've never even fired one.
L413200 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
L413199 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
L413198 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
L413197 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
L413195 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
L413194 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't believe me.
L413190 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ What the hell are you saying?
L413189 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ And your husband works for somebody else.
L413188 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ What?
L413187 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
L413186 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Who did?
L413185 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No.
L413184 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ You shot her?
L413183 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
L413182 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ How do you know that?
L413178 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ It was because I had this...in my pocket
L413177 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ You were very nervous.
L413176 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ That's right.
L413175 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ I remember you...in the elevator.
L413174 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
L413173 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Ah.
L413172 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I have a problem.
L413171 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ That's...a comfort to hear.
L413170 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
L413169 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
L413168 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I appreciate that.
L413167 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ My security people are right next door.
L413166 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
L412790 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
L412789 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
L412788 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ Yes?
L412787 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I...
L412786 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ You were saying?  Your daughter....?
L412781 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Its'...ah...about my daughter....
L412780 +++$+++ u2270 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ ELEANOR GRANT +++$+++ What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
L412779 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I need your help.
L413060 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
L413059 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ You know what I'm gonna do.
L413058 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
L413057 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Don't you threaten me.
L413056 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I talk to her or you can forget about it.
L413055 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Forget about it.
L413054 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I want'to talk to her.
L413053 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ No.
L413052 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Let me talk to her again.
L413051 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ ...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
L413050 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ That's right. That gives you...
L413049 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ One thirty. California Ballroom.
L413023 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No, please...
L413022 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Again.
L413008 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
L413007 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Come back.
L413006 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
L413005 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ How am I supposed to get away?
L413004 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
L413003 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
L413002 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I kill her - and you kill me.
L413001 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Do you now, Mr. Watson?
L413000 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
L412982 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ You fucked up.
L412981 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I killed you.
L412886 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
L412885 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You killed him.
L412884 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Tell me why he's dead.
L412883 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ How should I...?
L412882 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
L412881 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ He's dead?
L412880 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Tell me why I miss him.
L412879 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What...?
L412864 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Me?
L412863 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What would you do in my place?
L412843 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Then I have time for a drink.
L412842 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ You get another chance in ten minutes.
L412805 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ You...
L412804 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
L412803 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ What about the gun?
L412802 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ The gun...
L412801 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Are you 'fucking with me!?
L412767 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
L412766 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Where did you get these? Who are you?
L412765 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
L412764 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
L412763 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ This says "invitation only".
L412716 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
L412715 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ At one thirty my little girl is dead.
L412714 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
L412682 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
L412681 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I will do no such thing.
L412680 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ What's your point?
L412679 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You're out of your mind.
L412676 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
L412675 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes, I'm listening.
L412674 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
L412673 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Good.
L412672 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes, yes, I understand.
L412668 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You wouldn't...
L412667 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
L412654 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
L412653 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Daddy?
L412644 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Don't worry. She's good with kids.
L412643 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
L412639 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'd like to know what...
L412638 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Come with us, sir.
L412635 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes.
L412634 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
L412633 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
L412629 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What?
L412628 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Could I see some identification, sir?
L412947 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
L412946 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ We have to hurry.
L412943 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
L412942 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
L412933 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I think you're right.
L412932 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I think you better put that away.
L412930 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Okay...
L412929 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
L412928 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ But...
L412927 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
L412926 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Are you sure?
L412922 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
L412921 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
L412917 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
L412916 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
L412915 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I don't know.
L412912 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
L412911 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No! You can't! They're in on it.
L412910 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
L412904 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
L412903 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
L412902 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
L412901 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
L412900 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
L412794 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No, that's,..that's fine
L412793 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ Is that something precious?
L413083 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ No, kisses to...
L413082 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No. Kisses to you.

L413076 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.

L412625 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Right.
L412624 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
L412622 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Let' s do it.
L412621 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Nods.

L412603 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
L412589 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ We made it.
L412588 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
L412587 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?

L413323 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Thanks for the shine.
L413211 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
L413210 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What are you going to do!?
L413208 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What are you going to do now?
L413207 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I don't know.
L413206 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Well?
L413161 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
L413160 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What am I supposed to say to her?
L413157 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What!?
L413156 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You're going to go see her.
L413155 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yeah.
L413154 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
L413152 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Thank you.
L413151 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Irene is going to help.
L413150 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Hi.
L413149 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Meet Irene.
L413122 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Don't think I won't.
L413121 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Keep the change.
L413118 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L413117 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
L413116 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
L413115 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
L413114 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
L413113 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Yeah, all right, listen...
L413112 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
L413111 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
L413110 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Then why'd you drag me into it?
L413109 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
L413108 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Oh, Jesus ...
L413107 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
L413106 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Who?
L413105 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
L413104 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
L413103 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Kill the Governor.
L413102 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What are you supposed to do?
L413101 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
L413100 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
L413099 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
L413097 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
L413096 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ That's right.
L413095 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
L413094 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What?
L413093 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Cover your mouth.
L413092 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
L413091 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Mister, what are you dragging me into?
L413040 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
L413039 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Please...
L413038 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
L413037 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Please. Something is going to happen...
L413036 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Oh, man...
L413035 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
L413034 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I remember. The big tipper.
L413033 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You remember me?
L412840 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
L412839 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
L412837 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Keep it.
L412836 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ It's a twenty.
L412835 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Keep it.
L412834 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You got anything smaller?
L412831 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Is within himself.
L412830 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
L412829 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I said I have to do something.
L412828 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
L412827 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I have to do something.
L412822 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
L412821 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'm just an accountant.
L412820 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What do you do, if I may be so bold?
L413300 +++$+++ u2276 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MS. JONES +++$+++ Fuck you!
L413299 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Gimme a dollar.

L413296 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
L413294 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I think this is worth a dollar.
L413293 +++$+++ u2276 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MS. JONES +++$+++ Hey!
L413292 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I don't think so.
L413291 +++$+++ u2276 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MS. JONES +++$+++ Fuckin' A.
L413290 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
L413289 +++$+++ u2276 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MS. JONES +++$+++ I don't have to pay you nothin'.
L413288 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
L413287 +++$+++ u2276 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MS. JONES +++$+++ For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
L413286 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
L413285 +++$+++ u2276 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MS. JONES +++$+++ No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
L413284 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
L413283 +++$+++ u2276 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MS. JONES +++$+++ I don't want my windshield cleaned.
L413282 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
L412967 +++$+++ u2277 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MYSTERY MAN +++$+++ Could I see it?
L412966 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
L412965 +++$+++ u2277 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MYSTERY MAN +++$+++ Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
L412963 +++$+++ u2277 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MYSTERY MAN +++$+++ I see. Where is this gun?

L412960 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
L413279 +++$+++ u2276 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MS. JONES +++$+++ You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
L413278 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ A surprise?
