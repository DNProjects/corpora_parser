L488213 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
L488197 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What now?
L488196 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
L488195 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Can't we hold him?
L488024 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ 37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
L488023 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ How's the name search going?
L488021 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
L488020 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I can do it, Captain.
L487919 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ We're aware of that.
L487918 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
L487917 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ We know that, son.
L488170 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ On national television.
L488169 +++$+++ u7483 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ I would say we are now officially baffled.
L488168 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
L488167 +++$+++ u7483 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ You're sure about this two person thing?
L488166 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ They've broken their pattern.
L488165 +++$+++ u7483 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ He's broken his pattern.
L487936 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
L487935 +++$+++ u7483 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
L487914 +++$+++ u7483 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
L487913 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
L487887 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ Take the neighborhood.
L487886 +++$+++ u7483 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
L487885 +++$+++ u7463 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYLER +++$+++ Have you checked the...
L487830 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.

L487817 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ I can't believe you're alone in that house.
L487816 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Stop it...
L487815 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...

L487812 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I heard a noise.
L487811 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ What is it?
L487810 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Shit.
L487809 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
L487808 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
L487787 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
L487786 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ Don't. Think Bailey.
L487785 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I won't.
L487784 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
L487777 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
L487776 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ thought he was doing AA.
L487775 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
L487862 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Don't forget to set the alarm.
L487861 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ WHAAAATT?
L487860 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ No, it's me.
L487859 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Hello? Ted?
L487803 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
L487802 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I'm inquisitive.
L487801 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Why do you always answer a question with a question?
L487800 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Why would you wanna do that?
L487799 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ What if I said goodbye?
L487798 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ What if I said you?
L487797 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ "Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
L487796 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ That's too bad.
L487795 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
L487794 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Why aren't you there?
L487793 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
L487792 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Where is everybody?
L487791 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
L487790 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ That's okay.
L487789 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
L487783 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
L487782 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Someone who wants to talk to you.
L487781 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Cici. Who's this?
L487780 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Who is this?
L487779 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Yes.
L487854 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
L487853 +++$+++ u7466 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DAWNIE +++$+++ Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
L487847 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Just some asshole trying to scare me.
L487846 +++$+++ u7466 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DAWNIE +++$+++ I had to change. Did anyone call?
L487845 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I thought you were going to the mixer?
L487844 +++$+++ u7466 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DAWNIE +++$+++ I live here.
L487843 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
L488489 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Not until you’re dead.
L488488 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It’s over, Cotton.
L488487 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
L488486 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
L488485 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
L488108 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
L488107 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What?
L488106 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ It helped me realize one thing.
L488105 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Did it?
L488104 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
L488103 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
L488102 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
L488101 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
L488100 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
L488099 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I did that.
L488098 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You could start with an apology.
L488097 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What do you want from me, Cotton?
L488096 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
L488095 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I don't think that's a good idea.
L488094 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Can we talk?
L488093 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Cotton.
L488208 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
L488207 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
L488206 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
L488205 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
L488204 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
L488203 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You have a right to be angry.
L488202 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
L488201 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Did you do it?
L488200 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
L488476 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Enter Cotton Weary.
L488475 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ But you’ll never get away with it.
L488474 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Finish what my son started.
L488473 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L488466 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
L488465 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
L488460 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You’re all in this together?
L488459 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
L487977 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
L487976 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
L487975 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ No, I don't.
L487974 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
L487973 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Why don't you ask them?
L487972 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ And are the police sure about that?
L487971 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Home--where he lives.
L487970 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Where is Sidney's father?
L487969 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Tons and tons.
L487968 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Hi, Gale, any leads?
L487703 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Good for you.
L487702 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
L487701 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Do I know you? You look familiar.
L487700 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ And much richer as a result.
L487699 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
L487698 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
L487697 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Fair enough.
L487696 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
L487695 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry about the face.
L488230 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You freakin?
L488229 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Yeah.
L488228 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No way.
L488227 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ She dumped me.
L488226 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Where's Sid?
L488225 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Not one bit.
L488224 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
L488075 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Definitely Whitney.
L488074 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ "And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
L488073 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I think he's doing Dolly.
L488061 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
L488060 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I could use some therapy.
L488039 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
L488038 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What's your subject?
L488037 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ My documentary is due on Tuesday.
L487732 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
L487731 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ How do you put up with this Greek shit?
L488447 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
L488446 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
L488413 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You’re not going to get away with this.
L488412 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
L488393 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Good question. You took the bait.
L488392 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why?
L488381 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ That’s quick.
L488380 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No. This is a set up.
L488379 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Go on, untie him.
L488124 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
L488123 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
L488122 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
L488121 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, it's not.
L488120 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
L487966 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ It's under control.
L487965 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
L487964 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Let us decide that.
L487963 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
L487960 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I think it's out of your control.
L487959 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ This is exactly what I don't want.
L487892 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'll get my jacket.
L487891 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Lemme take you home.
L487877 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ The forbidden subject.
L487876 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ About what?
L487871 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
L487870 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
L487729 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Sid, you don't have to.
L487728 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
L487688 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
L487687 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
L487686 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
L487685 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
L488462 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Tuition’s expensive.
L488461 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ We had to have financing.
L488430 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Tails.
L488429 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
L488428 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
L488427 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Just for you, Sid.
L488426 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
L488425 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Or it found us.
L488424 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ So we found a compromise.
L488423 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
L488422 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ ..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
L488421 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
L488420 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ A twist ending if you will.
L488419 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
L488418 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ And now, drum roll please...
L488417 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
L488416 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
L488415 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
L488414 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
L488409 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Until now.
L488408 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ You’re the one who got away.
L488407 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
L488406 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
L488405 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
L488404 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ He sent me the cutest e-mail.
L488397 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I find his work overwrought.
L488396 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ He hates Oliver Stone.
L488395 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
L488394 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
L488391 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
L488390 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
L488388 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ I got it..
L488387 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Need some help, honey.
L488063 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
L488062 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ He seemed harmless.
L488051 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Randy somebody.
L488050 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ What guy?
L488049 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ She's got guards with her.
L488046 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
L488045 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
L488044 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Damned if I know. She ditched me.
L488043 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Where's Sid?
L487953 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
L487952 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
L487951 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Two.
L488327 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ There's nothing. I'm coming down.
L488326 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Dewey?
L488323 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No, wait here.
L488322 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Let's go.
L488318 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ He filmed his victims.
L488317 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Jesus Christ!
L488314 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ C'mon. Let's go.
L488313 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
L488311 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Over here.
L488310 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ This is all too familiar.
L488309 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Let's find out.
L488308 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Ssshh! What was that?
L488292 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Hallie?
L488291 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
L488290 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
L488289 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And Joel's pre-med.
L488288 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ They're roomates.
L488286 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ We'd break some furniture.
L488285 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ ..and as lonely as I am...
L488284 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
L488283 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Dewey, you and I would never make it.
L488282 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ And it's sexier in the dark.
L488281 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ That's not the way it's done.
L488280 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Can we turn the light on?
L488279 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
L488278 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What are we looking for?
L488277 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You broke my heart.
L488271 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Billy had alibis too.
L488270 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
L488269 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
L488268 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Meaning?
L488267 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
L488194 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Not good.
L488193 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Not good. How you doin?
L488135 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
L488134 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Yeah?
L488133 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I know that.
L488132 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
L488131 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I think you're all an act.
L488130 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
L488129 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
L488128 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
L487751 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
L487750 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
L487749 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
L487748 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I never meant to imply...
L487747 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
L487746 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You have every right to be upset.
L487745 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
L487744 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
L487743 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
L487742 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
L487741 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
L487740 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I see you read the book.
L487739 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
L487737 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
L487736 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
L487735 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Miss Weathers.
L487734 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Hello, Dwight.
L488273 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Whatever.
L488272 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
L488249 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Humor me, Sid.
L488248 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Dewey, there's no such place.
L488247 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
L487654 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
L487653 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Just in case...
L487652 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
L487651 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Don't worry...
L487650 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
L487647 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
L487646 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
L487645 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L487644 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
L487643 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
L487642 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
L487641 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Oh my God. How could it happen?
L487640 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ They thought it was a publicity stunt.
L487639 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
L487998 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Watch your back.
L487997 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ No, wait...

L487993 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L487992 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ It's what you want from me.
L487991 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L487990 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Stay away from the cop.
L487989 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Oh--a God complex

L487984 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ What if your life depended on it?
L487983 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I don't play games.
L487982 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ That's not the way we play the game.
L487981 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Who are you?
L487980 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I'll give you one guess.
L487979 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Who is this?
L488454 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Oh my God.
L488453 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What?
L488253 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But who would operate your camera?
L488252 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Sid, I'll come with you.
L487763 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ My morn was a Delta.

L487761 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
L487760 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
L487759 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
L487758 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L487757 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
L487756 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Sidney. Hello. How are you?
L488369 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ The safety what? Fuck that!

L488449 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
L488448 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
L488258 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's not a good idea, Hallie.
L488257 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ I'm the only one who can cut him down.
L488251 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
L488250 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Can I come with her?
L488246 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'd really just like to be alone.
L488245 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
L488236 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
L488235 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
L488234 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ We're missing the Sig Ep party.
L488012 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
L488011 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
L488010 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
L488009 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Who is that guy?
L488006 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L488005 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ That was good.
L487950 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
L487949 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Gotta.
L487948 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ What about rehearsal?
L487947 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Please, I have the perfect excuse.
L487946 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
L487623 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
L487622 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Time to change numbers again?
L487614 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Hello?  Hello?
L487613 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Knock yourself out.
L487604 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
L487603 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ The young girl is slashed again.
L487602 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
L487601 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
L487598 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
L487597 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
L487591 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
L487590 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
L487584 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
L487583 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
L488066 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
L488065 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Easy black boy.
L488064 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ And white.
L488054 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
L488053 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Her old boyfriend?
L488052 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
L488048 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
L488047 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I've been waiting for you, baby.
L487945 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I counted four.
L487944 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ How many guys they have on you?
L487962 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But...
L487961 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
L487955 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
L487954 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
L487719 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Thanks, Joel.
L487718 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
L487717 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You're not allowed to ask that.
L487716 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
L487713 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
L487712 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
L488222 +++$+++ u7475 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I just love being a sister.
L488221 +++$+++ u7479 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ ..harmonica style is okay.
L488220 +++$+++ u7475 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ ..it's really about family and tradition...
L488219 +++$+++ u7479 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ ..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
L488218 +++$+++ u7475 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
L487725 +++$+++ u7479 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
L487724 +++$+++ u7475 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
L487723 +++$+++ u7479 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ ..this week's TKE kegger...
L488157 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
L488156 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Do you want to die?
L488151 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Closer than you think.
L488150 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
L488149 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ What's your favorite scary movie?
L488148 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
L488143 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ But she's standing right next to you.
L488142 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ She's not here right now.
L488141 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Gale?
L488140 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Hello?
L487577 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
L487576 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ We can still Sandra Bullock it.
L487575 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
L487574 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
L487573 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ I get scared really easy, okay.
L487572 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
L487571 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ You are so not funny.
L487570 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
L487569 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ You ass.
L487562 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
L487561 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Shush.
L487560 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
L487549 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
L487548 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
L487545 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ Now.
L487544 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ But...
L487543 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ Take it off.
L487536 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ We got free tickets.
L487535 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
L487534 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
L487533 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ I hate scary movies.
L488356 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Don't panic.
L488355 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What was that?
L488352 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Where you going?
L488351 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L488349 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He's after me.
L488348 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L488347 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
L488346 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
L488119 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
L488118 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Thanks for the movie, Randy.
L488117 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
L488116 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
L488115 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
L488114 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
L488113 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
L488017 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Me, too. Randy. Me too.
L488016 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
L488015 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Do you work for her now?
L488014 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
L488013 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What do you want?
