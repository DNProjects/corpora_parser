L550987 +++$+++ u3053 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ BEEMER +++$+++ I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
L550986 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
L550985 +++$+++ u3053 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ BEEMER +++$+++ Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
L550984 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
L550983 +++$+++ u3053 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ BEEMER +++$+++ Bullshit politics.
L550982 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
L550981 +++$+++ u3053 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ BEEMER +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
L550726 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ A star is born.
L550725 +++$+++ u3054 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ EDUARDO +++$+++ No problem.
L550724 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
L550723 +++$+++ u3054 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ EDUARDO +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L550722 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
L550721 +++$+++ u3054 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ EDUARDO +++$+++ Hey, fuck you, man.
L550720 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
L550719 +++$+++ u3054 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ EDUARDO +++$+++ What's all this squid shit?
L550718 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
L551312 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I live for the moment.
L551311 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
L551310 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
L551065 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Maybe later.
L551064 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Fuck you.
L551063 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
L551062 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
L551061 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
L551060 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
L551059 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You said you were going to get her out of this.
L551057 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ You're going down.
L551056 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I made my choice, Lenny.
L551051 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
L551050 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
L550939 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
L550938 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You're too goddamned paranoid.
L550937 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
L550936 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Leave him alone, Tran.
L550935 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
L550931 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
L550930 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
L551428 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ 'We might as well make the best of it.'
L551427 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
L551426 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
L551425 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
L551424 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
L551423 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
L551388 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ My God.
L551387 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
L551385 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
L551384 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Jesus.
L551383 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
L551382 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You can't just... kill him.
L551381 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What're you going to do?
L551380 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
L551379 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
L551378 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
L551300 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What a nightmare.
L551299 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
L551298 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You think Tran killed her?
L551297 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
L551296 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
L551286 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No.  Mace is in this.
L551285 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ We should talk alone.
L551284 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
L551283 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
L551282 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
L551281 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What's going on?
L551048 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Tell me.
L551047 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You don't know what you're fucking with here.
L551046 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
L551045 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
L551044 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
L551043 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Who did it?
L551042 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
L551041 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
L550969 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
L550968 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Can't do it.
L550967 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
L550966 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
L550965 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
L550964 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
L550963 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Damn right.
L550962 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
L550961 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
L550960 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Maybe.
L550959 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What?  He gonna record you on his label?
L550958 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He has his uses too.
L550957 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
L550956 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ That's a good one, coming from you.
L550955 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
L550954 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
L550953 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
L550952 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
L550951 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Tonight.
L550950 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You talked to Iris?  When?
L550949 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
L550948 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You have to go.  I mean it.
L550947 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I'm already hurting.
L550946 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
L550945 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
L550933 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No, Lenny.
L550932 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Faith, call me, okay?
L550926 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I just got to talk to you for one second.
L550925 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
L550920 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
L550919 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Cut it out, Tran.
L550881 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Make me forget it, baby.
L550880 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Forget it's there.
L550879 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
L550878 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
L550877 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
L550736 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Watch and see.
L550735 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
L550773 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
L550772 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
L550769 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Step into my office.
L550768 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ What?  Right Here?
L550767 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
L550766 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Talk to me about costs, here.
L550765 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
L550764 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Sounds good.
L550761 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
L550760 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ What kind of things exactly?
L550759 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
L550758 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Clips.
L550757 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
L550756 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
L550755 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
L550754 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ No.
L550750 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ That's right.
L550749 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
L550748 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ I understand.  No, I'm not.
L551421 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
L551420 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ How did you hook up with Faith?
L551419 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
L551418 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
L551417 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Naawww.
L551416 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So there never was a death squad.
L551414 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You got froggy on me a couple times.
L551413 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
L551412 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
L551411 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
L551410 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
L551409 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
L551408 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I won't say anything.
L551407 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
L551405 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You bet.  Did you like it?
L551404 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
L551403 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
L551402 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
L551401 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's pretty much the way it happened.
L551400 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
L551399 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
L551398 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Jesus!
L551397 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You just did.
L551396 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
L551395 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
L551394 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Where's Faith?
L551393 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
L551392 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Only way I could stand your ties.
L551391 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
L551321 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I intend to.
L551320 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ 2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
L551319 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
L551318 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
L551317 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
L551316 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L551315 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
L551269 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No.  Bad idea.
L551268 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay... what about Strickland?
L551267 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
L551264 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
L551263 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
L551262 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Jesus.
L551261 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
L551260 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What stuff?
L551259 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
L551258 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Whattya mean?
L551252 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
L551251 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Is he dead?
L551250 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He's been cooked-off
L551248 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
L551247 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
L551119 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
L551118 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
L551117 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
L551116 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Looks like she was holding out.
L551115 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
L551114 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Faith OK?
L551112 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ W'sup, Max?
L551111 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
L551029 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Why me?
L551028 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
L551025 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
L551024 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Top ten.
L551023 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ But this is a bad one.
L551022 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So've I.  Too much.
L551021 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
L551020 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
L551019 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He records himself raping and killing her--
L551018 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
L551017 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
L551016 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
L551015 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Not now... I don't want to think about it--
L551014 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let's work it.
L551013 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah.  No, not really.
L551012 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You alright?  Y'okay?
L550976 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm on her.
L550975 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
L550974 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
L550973 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You should feel like shit.
L550972 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
L550971 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
L550826 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Shutup a second!
L550825 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
L550818 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
L550817 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
L550816 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
L550798 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hey, Iris, you okay?
L550797 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
L550796 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
L550795 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
L550794 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Naw.  She won't call me.
L550792 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
L550791 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You were lucky, Max.
L550789 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
L550788 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's not sayin' much.
L550787 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
L550786 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
L550785 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Thanks, Max.
L550784 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
L550781 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Least you can do.
L550780 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
L550779 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
L550778 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
L551155 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She never gave me a tape.
L551154 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
L551153 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What clip?  What was it?
L551152 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
L551151 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
L551150 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Iris, man.  Pay attention.
L551149 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Who was just here?
L551148 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
L551147 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What?
L551146 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
L551143 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Well... the guy's fucked up.
L551142 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
L551141 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
L550690 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What else you got?
L550689 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
L550688 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
L550687 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
L550686 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
L550685 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
L550684 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
L550683 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
L550682 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
L550681 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So lay it off to somebody else.
L550680 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
L550679 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
L550678 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
L550677 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
L550676 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
L550675 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
L550674 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
L550673 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
L550672 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Sorry.
L550671 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
L550670 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
L551055 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
L551054 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's alright.  He means it.
L551053 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
L551052 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Charm.
L550928 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
L550927 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ About what?
L550924 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Faith, can I talk to you a second?
L550923 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ I always do.
L550922 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
L550921 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
L550918 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ I already got everything I need from you.
L550917 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
L550916 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
L550873 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ Your existence.
L550872 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Your sex life?
L550871 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
L550870 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
L550869 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
L550868 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
L550867 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ Commissioner Strickland.
L550866 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Strickland.
L550865 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ Nero.
L551451 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah.  See you there.
L551450 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ See you downtown.
L551449 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
L551448 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah.  We did.
L551447 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
L551443 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
L551442 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Are we under arrest?
L551363 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Fucked.
L551362 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Then we'll be right where we are now.
L551361 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
L551360 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No.  Trust me.
L551359 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
L551358 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Take it to him.
L551354 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
L551353 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ That's the original.  There are no copies.
L551352 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
L551351 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
L551350 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Alright.  We're going up.
L551348 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Uh unh.
L551347 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You see Tran?
L551346 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
L551345 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Got your ticket?
L551344 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
L551343 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace... you're a girl.
L551340 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No, it's not.
L551339 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
L551338 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You never told me.
L551337 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
L551336 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No.  It didn't.
L551335 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
L551334 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I guess.
L551333 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
L551332 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
L551325 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
L551324 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
L551323 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I'm not going.
L551322 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
L551294 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
L551293 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
L551271 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
L551270 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Who's Strickland?
L551266 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, right, blow it open.
L551265 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
L551254 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ How long does it last?  Oh.
L551253 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He's totally cut off from the outer world.
L551246 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
L551245 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Why?
L551244 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
L551243 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
L551242 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It was a tough call.
L551241 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
L551240 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ There's a plus side?
L551239 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Well, look at the plus side.
L551238 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
L551232 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
L551231 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
L551230 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I've got a good idea, yeah.
L551229 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
L551228 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
L551226 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
L551225 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
L551224 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
L551203 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
L551202 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Uh unh.  I won't do it.
L551201 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
L551200 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Tell me.
L551192 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
L551191 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You sure?
L551190 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Those two guys were cops.
L551186 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
L551185 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
L551180 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Fire's out, isn't it?
L551179 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Are you out of your fucking mind?!
L551178 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ The gas tank's going to go any second!
L551177 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ This is bad.
L551176 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
L551175 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
L551174 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
L551173 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
L551172 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
L551171 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Shit!
L551166 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
L551165 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, give them the tape.
L551158 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Something in your car...
L551157 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
L551156 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
L551135 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
L551134 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, have you lost it completely?
L551131 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
L551130 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You better keep a low profile for a while.
L551129 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
L551128 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
L551126 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ This tie doesn't go with blue!
L551125 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What is it?
L551123 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
L551122 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Where we going?
L551121 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Jesus, Mace!
L551120 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Whatup Lenny?
L551103 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ S'okay.  I know you still love me.
L551102 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
L551101 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
L551100 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ How's Zander?
L551099 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Sure.
L551098 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
L551097 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Now you're really getting paranoid.
L551096 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ And what about the guy that was following me?
L551095 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ That's where it gets a little strange.
L551094 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
L551093 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
L551092 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
L551091 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So the guy's not a sicko.
L551090 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
L551089 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
L551088 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No it doesn't.
L551087 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ But that doesn't add, does it.
L551086 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
L551083 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L551082 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
L551081 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
L551080 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No more, Lenny.
L551079 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
L551078 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
L551077 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
L551076 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So that gives you something.
L551075 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
L551073 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Never really thought about it.
L551072 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
L551071 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Is this great fabric or what?
L551039 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
L551038 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
L551035 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
L551034 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
L551031 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
L551030 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
L551027 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Wants to share.
L551026 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ And gives it to you.
L551008 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Are you sure it's real?
L551007 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
L551006 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Blackjack?  I don't understand--
L551005 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Black.  Jack.
L551004 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ My God, Lenny.  What is it?
L551000 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
L550999 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What is it?
L550995 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No idea.
L550994 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What's that?  Present from Faith?
L550993 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
L550992 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
L550991 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
L550990 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
L550915 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You'll see.
L550914 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
L550913 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She's my destiny.
L550912 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
L550911 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She still loves me.
L550910 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Forget her.
L550909 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Rams... that's football, right?
L550908 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
L550907 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
L550905 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
L550904 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
L550903 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Jesus, Lenny.
L550902 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
L550901 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
L550900 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
L550899 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Look, I gotta get some sleep.
L550898 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
L550897 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
L550896 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Macey... I've never seen you like this.
L550895 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No, you're just trying to get off.
L550894 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So am I.  Just trying to get by.
L550893 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
L550892 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I thought we were friends.
L550891 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
L550890 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
L550889 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ That would be no.
L550887 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Get it.
L550886 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I need my case.  It's still in the back.
L550884 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ In LA?  Are you crazy?
L550883 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
L550882 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
L550876 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Let's talk in the car.
L550875 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Are we having a bad night?
L550864 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You will not live to see the morning.
L550863 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Coming with you.
L550862 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing?
L550860 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
L550859 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Fumitsu.
L550858 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What's his name?
L550856 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Define love.
L550855 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, but that was for love.
L550854 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
L550853 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Define illegal.
L550852 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, this shit's illegal.
L550851 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
L550850 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
L550849 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
L550848 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
L550847 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
L550846 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
L550845 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
L550844 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
L550843 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Driving Mr. Lenny.
L550842 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace!  You're a life-saver.
L550841 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
L550840 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
L550839 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
L550838 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
L550837 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
L550836 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Sleaze to peddle.
L550835 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
L550834 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
L550833 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
L550820 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
L550819 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
L551195 +++$+++ u3063 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ ZANDER +++$+++ Aw, Mom!
L551194 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
L551110 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Well give me some then... I'm starving.
L551109 +++$+++ u3063 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ ZANDER +++$+++ Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
L551108 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What is that?
L551107 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Are you going to make me beg?
L551106 +++$+++ u3063 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ ZANDER +++$+++ Right.  That explains it.
L551105 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Just Lenny.
L551104 +++$+++ u3063 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ ZANDER +++$+++ Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
L551276 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You really want that on your head?
L551275 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
L551274 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
L551273 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
L551257 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's more to this whole thing than you think.
L551256 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
L551255 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
L551037 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Take the tape to the cops.
L551036 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
L551033 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
L551032 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
L550830 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
L550829 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
L550828 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
L550827 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
L550822 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
L550821 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
