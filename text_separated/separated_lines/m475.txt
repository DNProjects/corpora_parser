L446558 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
L446557 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Just drunk enough.
L446556 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I think you're drunk.
L446554 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Maybe you're going to have to like me.
L446553 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
L446552 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How careful should I be?
L446551 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
L446550 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Why certainly, baby.
L446549 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I think I'd like to dance.
L446546 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How do you do?
L446545 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
L446446 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If I change my mind.
L446445 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
L446444 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Okay. You win.
L446443 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Would you mind?
L446442 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Don't I even get my face slapped?
L446441 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
L446440 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The brush-off, huh?
L446438 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
L446437 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
L446436 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
L446435 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I haven't been invited.
L446434 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
L446433 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sure you have.
L446432 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ We have some nice places around Vancouver.
L446431 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
L446430 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What's the matter?
L446429 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not tonight.
L446428 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
L446427 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
L446426 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ 
L446425 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
L446424 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes?
L446423 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
L446422 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
L446421 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm supposing.
L446420 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
L446419 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Thank you.
L446418 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No thanks?
L446417 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Very nice Mitchell turns.
L446416 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
L446350 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You don't know.
L446349 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know.
L446348 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Indefinitely?
L446347 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I really don't know.
L446346 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
L446345 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well..
L446344 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'll make one for you.  I live there.
L446343 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
L446342 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
L446341 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
L446340 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
L446309 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
L446308 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Vancouver, B.C.
L446307 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How far does this train go?
L446306 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
L446305 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
L446304 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
L446303 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
L446302 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
L446618 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Possibly, Miss.
L446617 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They might think I was running away from something.
L446616 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
L446615 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Immigration Officer?
L446614 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
L446613 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How long would that take?
L446612 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
L446611 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
L446610 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Good evening, Miss.
L446873 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
L446872 +++$+++ u7098 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
L446871 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Bank?
L446870 +++$+++ u7098 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
L446869 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
L446868 +++$+++ u7098 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Good morning. Can I do something for you?
L447454 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If I did-I don't-now.
L447453 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Do you think I was faking?
L447452 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I think you mean that.
L447447 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
L447446 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Me?
L447445 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
L447444 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
L447438 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
L447437 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
L447436 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Would I want to?
L447435 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
L447434 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
L447433 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Magruder does.
L447432 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
L447431 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
L447430 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Mitchell was dead enough.
L447429 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
L447428 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Mine?
L447427 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
L447426 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
L447424 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
L447423 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
L447376 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ So that I will never be found.
L447375 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
L447374 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
L447373 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
L447372 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You-killed-him?
L447371 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
L447370 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
L447369 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No.  I paid him off.
L447368 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
L447367 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It buys things, just like any other kind.
L447366 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
L447365 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
L447364 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What your father did doesn't condemn you.
L447363 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
L447362 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
L447361 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ In a way.
L447360 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
L447359 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
L447358 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
L447357 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Including Killaine.
L447356 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
L447354 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That's right.
L447353 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
L447352 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That, and the fun of it.
L447351 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you're doing all this just for me.
L447350 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Wonder what?
L447349 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
L447347 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
L447346 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Frozen.
L447345 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Cold?
L447344 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ There would be a moon tonight.
L447343 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
L447342 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ See anything?
L447283 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Killaine's wise to what?
L447282 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
L447271 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You leave it.
L447270 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Well?
L447269 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
L447268 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
L447267 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
L447266 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
L447265 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Do you have to leave the note?
L447264 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
L447263 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This must have cost a fortune.
L447262 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
L447244 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
L447243 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Killaine...
L447242 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
L447241 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
L447240 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
L447239 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And Betty Mayfield--
L447238 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
L447237 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They'll look for you.
L447236 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
L447235 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
L447234 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
L447233 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
L447232 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
L447231 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
L447230 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
L447229 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
L447228 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
L447227 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
L447225 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
L447224 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
L447223 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They're going to arrest me.
L447222 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No percentage in that.
L447221 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
L447192 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
L447191 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
L447190 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
L447189 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
L447188 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
L447187 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
L446867 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ From you, I like it.
L446866 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ So have I.
L446865 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
L446864 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No use waiting, then.
L446863 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Nothing matters.
L446862 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
L446861 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Try not talking.
L446860 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
L446859 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Anything I can do about it?
L446858 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
L446857 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Why?
L446856 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ All right--following me.
L446855 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Us?
L446854 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
L446853 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
L446852 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You don't know who he is?
L446851 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
L446836 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ We'll find out.
L446835 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Absolutely sure.
L446834 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
L446832 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Then he's-- 
L446831 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Couldn't be.
L446830 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Then he's got to be a detective.
L446829 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
L446828 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We walked right passed him. He's following us.
L446827 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I didn't notice him.
L446826 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
L446824 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
L446823 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They know you here--know your name.
L446822 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Why not?
L446821 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dance? Here?
L446820 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Want to dance?
L446810 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
L446809 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Is this the best you can do?
L446808 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Cold?
L446802 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'm different. I like it fine.
L446801 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
L446800 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Just who are you, anyway?
L446799 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Certainly not to me.
L446798 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
L446797 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dance? Tonight?
L446796 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
L446795 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's a lot of night left to live through.
L446794 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Quarter after one. Why?
L446793 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What time is it?
L446792 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That's putting it mildly.
L446791 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He could hardly help suspecting you.
L446790 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Bad enough.
L446789 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Bad?
L446786 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You didn't have to tell him that.
L446785 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
L446657 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No thanks.
L446656 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Want a spike in it?
L446655 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
L446654 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There wasn't any plane.
L446653 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You tried to run away.
L446652 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'd rather wait until it does matter.
L446651 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
L446649 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That's all there is.
L446648 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He was a great boy for that. What else?
L446647 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
L446646 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Nice of him.
L446645 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
L446644 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How did you meet him?
L446643 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't.
L446642 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ They'll know whether he killed himself.
L446640 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Sure... but somebody always does..
L446639 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
L446637 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
L446636 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He got in here how?
L446635 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
L446632 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's one less tonight.
L446631 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
L446630 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You said it wasn't a tragedy.
L446628 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
L446627 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Much too late.
L446626 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I know it's a littler late for an apology.
L446569 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No thank you.
L446568 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Dance?
L446488 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
L446487 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
L446486 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
L446485 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Do you think I don't?
L446484 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
L446483 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
L446482 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
L446481 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I didn't say anything.
L446480 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Whatever you say.
L446479 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Would it make you anymore amusing?
L446478 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
L446477 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're drinking it.
L446476 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
L446475 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And do you amuse the guests?
L446474 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
L446473 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
L446472 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
L446471 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ As I said before...
L446470 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
L446469 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
L446468 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
L446467 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What did you say his name was?
L446466 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
L446465 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
L446464 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It might be worth a Martini to you.
L446463 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I see.
L446462 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
L446461 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
L446460 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Your liquor laws..
L446450 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I see.
L446449 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
L446448 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, please.
L446447 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
L446459 +++$+++ u7105 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Right, Miss.
L446458 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ale. I don't mind.
L446457 +++$+++ u7105 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Beer or ale, Miss?
L446456 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Beer?  Well, all right.
L446455 +++$+++ u7105 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
L446454 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
L446453 +++$+++ u7105 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Yes, Miss.
L447469 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
L447468 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
L447467 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
L447466 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
L447465 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We know everything.
L447464 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
L447092 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Goodbye, Betty.
L447091 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
L447090 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Sometimes.
L447089 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You do things the hard way, don't you?
L447088 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
L447087 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But even if you were in love with me.
L447086 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I know that.
L447085 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
L447084 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
L447083 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
L447082 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
L447081 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
L447080 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What will they do to you?
L447079 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I can't answer that.
L447078 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ To do what?
L447077 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
L447076 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
L447075 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Because you think your in love with me?
L447074 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
L447073 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
L447072 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
L447071 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
L447070 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
L447069 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
L447068 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
L447067 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
L447066 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ They call me Jeff.
L447065 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
L447064 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
L447063 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Very ridiculous.
L447062 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
L447061 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What does he see?
L447060 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
L447059 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Points very straight to her.
L447058 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
L447054 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
L447053 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
L447052 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
L447051 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I expected nothing else.
L447047 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've come here to arrest you for murder.
L447046 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't want to talk.
L447045 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ This isn't a very good place to talk.
L446954 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There isn't anything you can do.
L446953 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
L446952 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You understand perfectly.
L446951 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ If I understand what you meant by that.
L446950 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
L446949 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
L446948 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
L446947 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We try to be decent.
L446946 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
L446945 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
L446944 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
L446943 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The police always do, don't they?
L446942 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
L446940 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
L446939 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You were there when I last saw him.
L446938 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
L446937 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Is it a crime?
L446936 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
L446935 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Who hasn't--one way or another?
L446934 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've had dealings with the police before?
L446933 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
L446932 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
L446931 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We wouldn't have met at all.
L446930 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
L446883 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I've never been to Florida.
L446882 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ FLorida?
L446881 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You must come from pretty far South.
L446880 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
L446879 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
L446878 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
L446877 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
L446782 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
L446781 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
L446780 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
L446778 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ A graduation present.
L446777 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Where's you get it?
L446776 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.
L446775 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ What this?
L446774 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
L446773 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
L446772 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L446771 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
L446770 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
L446766 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
L446765 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Who told you I was married?
L446764 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
L446738 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It is?
L446737 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's an evasion and you know it.
L446736 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
L446735 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Please answer my question.
L446734 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
L446733 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry, that's all there is.
L446732 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll have to know a little more than that.
L446731 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
L446730 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
L446729 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
L446728 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
L446894 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ This way.
L446893 +++$+++ u7103 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
L446889 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Who's Goble?
L446888 +++$+++ u7103 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
L446887 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ All right. Get him.
L446886 +++$+++ u7103 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
L446885 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Morning. Any calls?
L446884 +++$+++ u7103 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
L446928 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
L446927 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
L446926 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Why not here?
L446925 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
L446924 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Get it in half an hour.
L446923 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Got the information on you?
L446922 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Got it on you?
L446921 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ A thousand.
L446920 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
L446919 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You mentioned information.
L446918 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
L446917 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ For two hundred?
L446916 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I go home and paint the kitchen.
L446915 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ For five hundred, what do I get?
L446914 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Bluff. You've waited too long.
L446913 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
L446912 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
L446911 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
L446910 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
L446909 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
L446908 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
L446907 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
L446906 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
L446905 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What are your rates?
L446904 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
L446903 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Private eye?
L446902 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
L446901 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Name it.
L446900 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
L446899 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'm still asking. What do you want?
L446898 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ You asked for it.
L446897 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
L446892 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'm not interested in blind dates.
L446891 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I'd like a few words with you, in private.
L446668 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That comedian?
L446667 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
L446666 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
L446662 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
L446661 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Leave that one lay.
L446660 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ And without much discrimination.
L446659 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Sometimes.
L446658 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
L446524 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You, Killaine?
L446523 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Martini.
L446522 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What'll you have, Margo?
L446521 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Fascinated.
L446520 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
L446519 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
L446518 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
L446848 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
L446847 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ What's this in favor of?
L446846 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
L446845 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How are your teeth getting along?
L446844 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I've got good ears.
L446843 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Who told you my name?
L446842 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
L446841 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ So you're not a cop.
L446840 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ What's a buzzer?
L446839 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ All right, let's see the buzzer.
L447211 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
L447210 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You asked me where it all came from.
L447209 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ What?
L447208 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I had a father who knew how to steal.
L447207 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
L447206 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
L447205 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
L447204 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
L447203 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
L447202 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
L447201 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
L447200 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
L447198 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
L447197 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
L447181 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No idea.
L447180 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
L447179 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
L447178 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
L447177 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Mitchell was too drunk.
L447176 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
L447175 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
L447174 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
L447173 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
L447172 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
L447171 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
L447170 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That COULD BE TOLD.
L447169 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ It could have been an accident.
L447168 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
L447167 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Information.
L447166 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
L447165 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ The only answer I have for you.
L447164 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Doesn't answer the question.
L447163 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You'd be breaking the law.
L447162 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Would that make me a heel?
L447161 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
L447160 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That must hurt.
L447159 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I have a warrant for her arrest.
L447158 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ A couple of hours.
L447157 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
L447156 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Could we discuss that some other time?
L447155 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ "Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
L447154 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
L447153 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
L447152 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I never notice the view after the first week.
L447151 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
L447149 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thanks.  I don't mind.
L447148 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
L447147 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Time for a little chat?
L446807 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Well--good night.
L446806 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I don't.
L446805 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ In case you want to have us followed.
L446784 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
L446783 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How are you two getting along?
L446726 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
L446725 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How about a cup of coffee?
L446713 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We do, when we get the chance.
L446712 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
L446711 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ It was lying where on the balcony?
L446710 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No.
L446709 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
L446708 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Could be.
L446707 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Quite sure you had no motive?
L446706 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
L446705 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Where?
L446704 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Yes, I've seen it before.
L446703 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thank you.
L446580 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
L446579 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
L446578 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
L446577 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Hardly. Who's the girl?
L446576 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
L446544 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ If I can get off.
L446543 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Round of golf Saturday?
L446542 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ The usual grind.
L446541 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How's life treating you?
L446540 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
L446530 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You're not English.
L446529 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
L446528 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ A private joke.
L446527 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What?
L446566 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
L446565 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
L446564 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
L446563 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How would you know, Brandon?
L446562 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
L446561 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Did I do something wrong?
L446560 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
L446498 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
L446497 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Lay off, can't you?
L446496 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
L446495 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
L446494 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
L446413 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
L446412 +++$+++ u7090 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
L446411 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
L446410 +++$+++ u7090 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
L446409 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ A little something on account perhaps?
L446408 +++$+++ u7090 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ Mr. Mitchell.
L446407 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
L446761 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
L446760 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
L446759 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ With what motive?
L446758 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
L446757 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
L446756 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
L446755 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ Convenient, isn't it?
L446754 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
L446753 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
L446752 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ He saw my face too.
L446751 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
L446750 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That's not enough.
L446749 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
L446748 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
L446747 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You nasty, sardonic--
L446746 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
L446745 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
L446744 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
L446743 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Passkey?
L446742 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
L446741 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What do you want?
L446740 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I don't think you locked your door.
L446739 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L446664 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
L446663 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
L446355 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
L446354 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
L446715 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
L446714 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
L446699 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thank you.
L446698 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
L446697 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Recently, then.
L446696 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
L446695 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
L447401 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We don't need him.
L447400 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
L447399 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ What's the face for, Driscoll?
L447146 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Men like you don't need orders.
L447145 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
L447144 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
L447143 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
L447142 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
L447141 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
L447140 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Would you?
L447139 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Send that?
L447138 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
L447137 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
L447136 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
L447135 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
L447134 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
L447133 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
L447132 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
L447131 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
L447130 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Got a moment, Inspector?
L447035 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
L447034 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
L447033 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Let me know when you've identified him
L447032 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
L447031 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
L447030 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
L447029 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
L447028 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Not a floater.  Only just dead.
L447027 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Floater?
L447026 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
L446972 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.
L446971 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Open it and count it.
L446970 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
L446969 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
L446968 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ You get it's brother.
L446967 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ What do I get for it?
L446966 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
L446965 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
L446964 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
L446963 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
L446962 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ Go live in a tent.
L446961 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
L446960 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
L446959 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
L447341 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
L447340 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
L447338 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
L447337 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
L447336 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Did we ever really think it was suicide?
L447335 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ No suicide.
L447334 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
L447333 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
L447332 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
L447331 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
L447330 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon.
L447329 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So?
L447328 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
L447327 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Well.  What about it?
L447326 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ This is the shell.  What about the gun?
L447322 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
L447321 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Pretty big chance, huh?
L447320 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
L447319 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
L447318 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You can find out.
L447317 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Do I know who lives down there?
L447316 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
L447315 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Such as?
L447314 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
L447313 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
L447312 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
L447311 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
L447310 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
L447307 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Should be over there.
L447306 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Where's the shell?
L447305 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ I think so.
L447304 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Was that about the right angle?
L447301 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
L447300 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
L447299 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not too hard, is it?
L447297 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
L447296 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
L447280 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
L447279 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
L447278 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ "G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
L447276 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ I guess I'm just ballast around here.
L447275 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll know when I find it.
L447274 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
L446691 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
L446690 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
L446689 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
L446688 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Unless the gun was slanted up.
L446687 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So the shell ought to have gone over?
L446686 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
L446682 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
L446681 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
L446680 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
L446679 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've met her.
L446678 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ ... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
L446677 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
L446676 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
L446675 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
L446674 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Right.
L446673 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So it seems Sergeant.
L446672 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ You in charge here?
L447002 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
L447001 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ And if you didn't believe me?
L447000 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
L446999 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Now, you're being beastly.
L446998 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
L446997 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I don't understand.
L446996 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
L446995 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It does.  May I go now? 
L446994 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not if it clears the air.
L446993 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
L446992 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Mortar shells are not funny, either.
L446991 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Did you ever have a serious operation?
L446990 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You didn't play it for laughs last night.
L446989 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
L446988 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
L446987 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I am a fool.
L446986 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
L446985 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
L446984 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
L446983 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
L446982 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
L446981 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
L446724 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
L446723 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
L446722 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
L446721 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
L446720 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
L446719 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
L446718 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
L446717 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not quiet yet.
L446716 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What about me?
L446702 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Positive?
L446701 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I never saw it before.
L446526 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Warm water, no doubt.
L446525 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Scotch and plain water, I think.
L446517 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Are you always this witty?
L446516 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Oh nothing.
L446515 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ May you what?
L446512 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
L446511 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
L447398 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ Brandon handled the money envelope.
L447397 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ The card says so, doesn't it?
L447396 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
L447392 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll take your word.
L447391 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
L447390 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ She might.
L447389 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ Mayfield?  She fit into this?
L447388 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
L447387 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ So far.
L447386 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That leaves two strangers.
L447385 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ He checks too.
L447384 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ How about Magruder?
L447383 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ No doubt about that one.
L447381 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
L447380 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'm interested in who handled it.
L447379 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
L447126 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
L447125 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ What are my orders, sir?
L447124 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Get out of here!
L447123 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
L447122 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not too far, I hope.
L447121 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
L447120 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
L447119 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
L447118 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Two.
L447117 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ I believe you won decorations during the war.
L447115 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I do.
L447114 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ But you still think she's innocent.
L447113 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
L447112 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ "Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
L447111 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ "Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
L447110 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
L447109 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ "Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
L447108 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L447107 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
L447106 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
L447105 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Ye have, have ye?
L447104 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
L447103 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
L447102 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
L447101 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
L447100 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I don't know, sir.
L447099 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
L447098 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
L447097 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
L447021 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
L447020 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
L447017 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Aye.  You have a point there.
L447016 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
L447015 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ I hear she's a very pretty girl.
L447014 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ No.
L447011 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
L447010 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
L447009 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
L447008 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ How do you do, sir.
L447007 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
L446548 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
L446547 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
L446537 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I say YES!
L446536 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
L446535 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
L446534 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
L446533 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Be nasty.
L446532 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
L446531 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
L446406 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ In an hour, Larry.
L446405 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Right.
L446404 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
L446403 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I told you she's just..
L446402 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How about your new friend?
L446401 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Of course.
L446400 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
L446399 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
L446398 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You already have the checks, darling.
L446397 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
L446396 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Years, why?
L446395 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How long have you had it?
L446394 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What does it look like?
L446393 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What's this?
L446392 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
L446391 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's not very kind.
L446390 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
L446388 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
L446387 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
L446386 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You don't have to make a pose of it.
L446385 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
L446383 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
L446382 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What'll we do about it, Margo?
L446381 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
L446380 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You'd go to jail. For a long term.
L446379 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I have a rough idea.
L446378 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
L446377 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
L446375 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
L446374 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
L446373 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You ought to know why.
L446372 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
L446371 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
L446370 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
L446369 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
L446368 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
L446367 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Why should I mind?
L446366 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
L446365 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Nice.
L446364 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
L446363 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Who's the girl?
L446362 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ So-so.
L446361 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
L446360 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
