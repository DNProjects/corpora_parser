L350817 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Now will you get in the flask?
L350806 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
L350805 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Is this a joke?
L350804 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
L350803 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Little Nicky.
L350740 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
L350739 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
L350657 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I hear a train coming. Drink.
L350656 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Let her go.
L350655 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
L350383 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
L350382 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
L350381 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
L350380 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
L350379 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ He's sick?
L350378 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
L350375 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Please, get out of my mind!
L350374 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ You shouldn't have come here.
L350373 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ADRIAN!
L350864 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ Don't do it!
L350863 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ No!
L350825 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
L350824 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
L350650 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ You mother...
L350649 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
L350648 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ All right. Let me out.
L350647 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Hello, Cassius.
L350249 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
L350248 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
L350247 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ I lowered the drinking age to ten.
L350246 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
L350245 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ "Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
L350127 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ It's our time, brother.
L350126 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ ...their damned souls will be ours.
L350125 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
L350124 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
L350123 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ We could create our own hell there.
L350122 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ What do you think about... Earth?
L350121 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
L350120 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Could you concentrate for five seconds?
L350119 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ That's what I thought!
L350116 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
L350115 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
L350114 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ It's just such a slap in the face.
L350113 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ And he's dead serious.
L350112 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
L350067 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
L350066 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ I knew it. He's finally retiring.
L350802 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You want a queen? Got one right here.
L350801 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
L350645 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I'm calling you out, brother...
L350644 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Urr... uggg... errr...
L350643 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
L350642 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Uh. No it won't?
L350641 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
L350640 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And give you a good buzz.
L350637 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
L350636 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
L350624 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Sure, why not?
L350623 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
L350619 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Noon...
L350618 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
L350763 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
L350762 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ She goes to Parson's, right?
L350737 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ Show him Central Park.
L350736 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ All these good people have totally been led astray.
L350731 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
L350730 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ I'll call her later.
L350723 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
L350722 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
L350665 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ So excited.
L350664 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
L350785 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ You're already there...
L350784 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
L350783 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ It would be so okay.
L350782 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
L350776 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
L350775 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What is it?
L350773 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A speech impediment?
L350772 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
L350771 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
L350765 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Yeah, you do...
L350764 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
L350761 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ She's so nice.
L350760 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Valerie's crying!
L350735 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
L350734 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How did you see me?
L350729 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well tell her I said "hi" back.
L350728 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
L350721 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
L350720 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where did you meet my father?
L350685 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Angels don't get any older, son.
L350684 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How come you're not older?
L350680 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
L350679 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Wow. What... what did she look like?
L350678 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
L350677 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ An angel?
L350676 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Try an angel.
L350675 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ My mom wasn't a goat?
L350674 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
L350673 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
L350672 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
L350671 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Maybe try the opposite of that.
L350670 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
L350800 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ That turn you on there, RuPaul?
L350799 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
L350759 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ I can't screw.  I can't screw.
L350758 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
L350612 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
L350611 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Where is he? He's late.
L350432 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ No.
L350431 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Did you just talk?
L350430 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
L350429 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ What's Nicky doing down there?
L350567 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
L350566 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This is baloney!
L350562 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ I think you're looking at him.
L350561 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
L350560 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Look. You were really high. Things happen.
L350559 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I didn't murder anybody
L350556 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
L350555 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
L350486 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
L350485 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
L350407 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
L350406 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Release the evil?
L350405 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
L350404 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
L350403 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But those are my roommate's sodas...
L350402 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Go get a soda out of the fridge.
L350401 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
L350400 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
L350399 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What can I do about it?
L350398 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
L350264 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
L350263 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
L350254 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, let's rock and roll.
L350253 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
L350252 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
L350251 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
L350250 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
L350233 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
L350232 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
L350217 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
L350216 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
L350209 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
L350208 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
L350207 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
L350204 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Put it in your mouth.
L350203 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So far, so good. Now what?
L350202 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ That pain is hunger.
L350201 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
L350200 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
L350199 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's freezing up here, Beefy.
L350198 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Makin' friends already.
L350194 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh. Sorry.
L350193 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ It's not me, moron.
L350192 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
L350191 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
L350190 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
L350189 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
L350161 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
L350160 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
L350159 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Please, pop, just go back to your room.
L350158 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
L350157 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Everything's fine, pop.
L350156 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
L350144 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Now you're talking.
L350143 +++$+++ u1840 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
L350142 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
L350141 +++$+++ u1840 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You did it for Namath.
L350140 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
L350139 +++$+++ u1840 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
L350138 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
L350596 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
L350595 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
L350594 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Check one-two. Check one-two.
L350591 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
L350590 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I got no ears! I can't hear!
L350099 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
L350098 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
L350097 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Yes, Jimmy.
L350096 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Knock, knock.
L350859 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
L350858 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
L350854 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
L350853 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
L350852 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
L350851 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
L350850 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You came through, Nicky.
L350593 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
L350592 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
L350589 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
L350588 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
L350186 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
L350185 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
L350184 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
L350180 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Son, just do your best.
L350179 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. This can't be happening.
L350175 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
L350174 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
L350168 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
L350167 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So go get 'em, Dad!
L350166 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
L350155 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
L350154 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How bad?
L350153 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ This is bad, Nicky.
L350146 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
L350145 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're a good devil, Dad.
L350137 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I was just playing with you.
L350136 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Metallica, Dad. Come on.
L350135 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
L350134 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
L350133 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
L350132 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Definitely.
L350131 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
L350106 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
L350105 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I mean... tough break.
L350102 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
L350101 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
L350100 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
L350093 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
L350092 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
L350091 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Now everybody sit down.
L350088 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
L350087 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
L350260 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Beast.
L350259 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ Bus?
L350215 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You got it.
L350214 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350213 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350212 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ Thanks.
L350211 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That's a pretty brassiere.
L350210 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ Hey.
L350152 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ That's what I'm thinkin'...
L350151 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Coulda been much worse.
L350150 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
L350355 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
L350354 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
L350353 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ Boogerland!
L350352 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ What was it called, sir.
L350351 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
L350350 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ It's Stanley, sir.
L350349 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
L350347 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
L350346 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ I know, your wickedness.
L350345 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ You know, I was the one who created Hell.
L350183 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
L350182 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
L350173 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
L350172 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
L350171 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're not saying it's up to me?
L350170 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
L350169 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So go get 'em, Jimmy!
L350165 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
L350164 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
L350065 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
L350064 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
L350063 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey...
L350795 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
L350794 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
L350484 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Oh, would you grow up.
L350483 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Easy, Liberace.
L350478 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ No.
L350477 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ By she, do you mean he?
L350476 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
L350464 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
L350463 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No wonder your uncle's so weird...
L350757 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
L350756 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This don't look good.
L350631 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Peppermint... alright.
L350630 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Schnapps...
L350600 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We know where to find Nicky.
L350599 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Looking for the chief.
L350598 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Little nervous. Wanna puke.
L350597 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You sure you're down with this?
L350490 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
L350489 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's a big pass, Elton John.
L350428 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
L350427 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Look who's back from the dead.
L350281 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ The Dark Prince is here.
L350280 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did you check out the dragon mouth?
L350274 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah. You do it.
L350273 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Should we wake him up?
L350272 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
L350271 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
L350270 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's with that guy?
L350269 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
L350268 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ There's our man.
L350267 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ 'Bout time...
L350266 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
L350493 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ See ya, fellas.
L350492 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
L350491 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
L350468 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
L350467 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Come on. One more time.
L350461 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
L350460 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's Ozzy trying to say there?
L350278 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That way.
L350277 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Which way did he go?
L350397 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ I was DeNiro!
L350396 +++$+++ u1844 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ KATHY LEE +++$+++ Yes, great movie...
L350395 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
L350394 +++$+++ u1844 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ KATHY LEE +++$+++ You keep a bat under your seat?
L350393 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
L350392 +++$+++ u1844 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ KATHY LEE +++$+++ You followed him?
L350391 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ So I followed him...
L350390 +++$+++ u1844 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ KATHY LEE +++$+++ Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
L350389 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
L350842 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll just go to Heaven.
L350841 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You gotta kill yourself.
L350580 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
L350579 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Dude. Seriously?
L350578 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Good idea... kill me.
L350570 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Dude, it's us. Let us in.
L350569 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
L350470 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right...
L350469 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Please. You got to.
L350524 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
L350523 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ You got the wrong window again, man.
L350506 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Andrew.
L350505 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Adrian?
L350504 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ I don't need luck. I'm good.
L350503 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
L350502 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
L350501 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
L350500 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
L350499 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You smell like coconuts.
L350498 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Hello.
L350848 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I love you.
L350847 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ I love you.
L350846 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Do me.
L350831 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ From my dad's side of the family.
L350830 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
L350828 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That was Cassius!
L350827 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Nicky!
L350659 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I have to, Valerie.
L350658 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Don't do it.
L350548 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
L350547 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
L350546 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ East Rutherford.
L350545 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ We're going to Jersey?
L350544 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
L350543 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Can we go fly over Central Park?
L350537 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Okay, I do. Get back up here.
L350536 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
L350533 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
L350532 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ ..."The Devil?"...
L350531 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
L350530 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Yes...
L350529 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
L350528 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ What do you mean, "possessed?"
L350527 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
L350526 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
L350521 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
L350520 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
L350519 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Why would you be floating?
L350518 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I think I'm floating.
L350517 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L350516 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No.
L350515 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Are you dead?
L350514 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Valerie?
L350511 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
L350510 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ What were you thinking coming here?
L350508 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
L350507 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey.
L350370 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
L350369 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ What was that?
L350368 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
L350367 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ What?
L350366 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
L350365 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
L350364 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
L350363 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Basically, yeah.
L350362 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
L350343 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Good. I was concerned.
L350342 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Sometimes, sure.
L350341 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
L350339 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ My perfume?
L350338 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
L350337 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
L350336 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ School?
L350335 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
L350332 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
L350331 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ You have a dog? What kind?
L350330 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
L350329 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
L350327 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
L350326 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's freezing my hands.
L350325 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Uh, it's a deep south expression.
L350324 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ "Octopus people?"
L350323 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
L350322 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ If you want to.
L350321 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
L350320 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
L350319 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
L350318 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
L350317 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
L350316 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
L350315 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
L350314 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ My dad's an optometrist.
L350313 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
L350312 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Why are you laughing?
L350311 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
L350310 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Really?
L350309 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The South.
L350308 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
L350307 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You think I'm a tourist?
L350306 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
L350305 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
L350583 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
L350582 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That just hurt a lot.
L350482 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
L350481 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
L350419 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If it's Cassius, yes.
L350418 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A black guy?
L350417 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It looks like the work of a brother...
L350231 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
L350230 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know.
L350229 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Why is that funny?
L350228 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah. The deep South.
L350227 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
L350226 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No.
L350225 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
L350224 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Off limits.
L350223 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
L350222 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes. What is rent?
L350221 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
L350220 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
L350295 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
L350294 +++$+++ u1849 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STREET VENDOR +++$+++ Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
L350288 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know?
L350287 +++$+++ u1849 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STREET VENDOR +++$+++ And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
L350286 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
L350285 +++$+++ u1849 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STREET VENDOR +++$+++ You callin' me a thief, my man?
L350284 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes. I would like my flask back.
L350283 +++$+++ u1849 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STREET VENDOR +++$+++ See something you like, my man?
L350282 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey...
