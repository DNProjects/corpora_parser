L278465 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
L278444 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
L278443 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
L278442 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
L278441 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
L278440 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
L278433 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
L278432 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
L278431 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
L278430 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
L278429 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
L278428 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ And give a deposition to the jUdge.
L278427 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
L278401 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ --but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
L278400 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
L278399 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
L278398 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
L278397 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
L278395 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Allen?  He... he's okay?
L278394 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
L278393 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ It was you!  I thought I heard...
L278392 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
L278391 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
L278390 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
L278389 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Huh?  Whadda you mean?
L278388 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
L278387 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Right.
L278386 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
L278385 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
L278384 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
L278378 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
L278377 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
L278376 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
L278375 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
L278374 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
L278373 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ The bathroom!  For two days?
L278372 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I was in the can, for Chrissake.
L278371 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
L278370 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
L278369 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
L278368 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
L278367 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
L278365 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
L278364 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
L278363 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
L278360 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
L278359 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ LaPlante!
L278358 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
L277952 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.
L277951 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
L277950 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
L277949 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ I know a guy who only has one leg.
L277948 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
L277947 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ You should give it to someone with only one leg.
L277945 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
L277944 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
L277943 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
L277942 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You got a drinking problem or what?
L277940 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Try stupid.
L277939 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
L277938 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
L277937 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
L278189 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You mean John Bubber?
L278188 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
L278187 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
L278186 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
L278185 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
L278184 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
L278183 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
L278181 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
L278180 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
L278179 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
L278178 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
L278177 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I took a loan on my car and my computer.
L278176 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
L278069 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
L278068 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
L278067 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ "Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
L278066 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ "The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
L277672 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
L277671 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
L277670 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
L277669 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
L277668 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ It's November.
L277667 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
L277666 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ How recently?
L277665 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Often, uh.
L277664 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I understand.  How often do you see your son?
L277663 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
L277662 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
L277661 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
L277660 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
L277659 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
L277658 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
L277657 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ He gives a good report and I walk?
L277656 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
L277655 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
L277654 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
L277653 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ "Anticipation of incarceration"?
L277651 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
L277650 +++$+++ u5826 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I got your bail continued.
L277649 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
L277771 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
L277770 +++$+++ u5827 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Mister LaPlante...
L277769 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
L277768 +++$+++ u5827 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Mister LaPlante...
L277767 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
L277766 +++$+++ u5827 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Mister LaPlante...
L277765 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
L278252 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
L278251 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
L278250 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
L278249 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Nothin'.
L278248 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
L278247 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
L278246 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
L278245 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
L278244 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
L278243 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
L278224 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
L278223 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
L278032 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?

L277719 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
L277718 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ We're all assholes, Bernie?
L277717 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
L277716 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ I didn't even know you had a kid.
L277715 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?

L277710 +++$+++ u5823 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
L277709 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ 'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?

L277930 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
L277929 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
L277928 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
L277927 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!

L277925 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
L277924 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
L277923 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
L277922 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ "Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
L277921 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
L277920 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
L277919 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
L277918 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
L277917 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
L277916 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.

L277911 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
L277910 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He waited for you three hours!
L278481 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
L278480 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
L278479 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
L278478 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...

L278476 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
L278475 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I snuck in.
L278344 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
L278343 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
L278342 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
L278341 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Lie, you mean...
L278340 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
L278339 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
L278338 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
L278333 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
L278332 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Underbelly!
L278331 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.

L278325 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
L278324 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
L278323 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
L278322 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?

L278315 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
L278304 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
L278303 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...

L278301 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Turn that thing off.
L278300 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
L278299 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You!
L278511 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
L278510 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Uh, no.
L278509 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
L278494 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ JOEY!
L278493 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.

L277701 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
L277700 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...

L277680 +++$+++ u5821 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
L277679 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.

L278350 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
L278240 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
L278239 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ It's not right, Gale...

L278130 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
L278129 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
L278128 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
L278116 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
L278115 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
L278111 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ ...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
L278110 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Yes.
L278109 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
L278106 +++$+++ u5822 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ BUBBER +++$+++ Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --

L278337 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
L278336 +++$+++ u5824 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHUCKY +++$+++ He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
L278335 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
L278334 +++$+++ u5824 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHUCKY +++$+++ Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!

L278289 +++$+++ u5824 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHUCKY +++$+++ Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
L278288 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
L278287 +++$+++ u5824 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHUCKY +++$+++ We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
L277741 +++$+++ u5824 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHUCKY +++$+++ I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
L277740 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
L277731 +++$+++ u5824 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ CHUCKY +++$+++ Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
L277730 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
L278174 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
L278173 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ How'd it go?
L278013 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
L278012 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
L277961 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
L277960 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ We're piecing together different accounts and...
L277957 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
L277956 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You said all the passengers were accounted for...
L277955 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
L277760 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
L277759 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ That too.
L277758 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
L277757 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
L277751 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ You're sitting on your ticket.
L277750 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You just can't bear the idea of good news.
L277749 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Unprofessional.
L277748 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
L278508 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
L278507 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ The Presidency.  The public loves him.
L278506 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ What?
L278505 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ It's not unthinkable.
L278414 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
L278413 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Helluva story!
L278412 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
L278411 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
L278406 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ She can't quit.
L278405 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ She wants to quit?
L278404 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
L278403 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Quit?  She wants to quit?
L278402 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
L278172 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
L278171 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ She's talking to him now.
L278170 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
L278169 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Said he's not an actor.
L278168 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Upset!  What's he upset about?
L278095 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
L278094 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
L278093 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
L278092 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
L278011 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ What about a reward for coming forward?
L278010 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
L278009 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
L278008 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
L277754 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
L277753 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
L277752 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Ticket!  What's going on?
L277743 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
L277742 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
L277739 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
L277738 +++$+++ u5825 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ DEAKINS +++$+++ He's right.  It's unprofessional.
L278448 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Dad!
L278447 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh my God!  Bernie!
L278420 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...
L278419 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What's "cynical"?
L278418 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
L278408 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
L278407 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
L278026 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I... I saw him out the window.
L278025 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You were in bed.  Weren't you?
L278024 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
L278018 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
L278017 +++$+++ u5828 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
L278016 +++$+++ u5831 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ He lost a shoe!
L277756 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
L277755 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
L277746 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
L277745 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ You didn't?
L277744 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
L277737 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Hello, Mister Wallace.
L277736 +++$+++ u5834 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Never reach out!
L277735 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
L278285 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
L278284 +++$+++ u5835 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
L278281 +++$+++ u5835 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
L278280 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
L278278 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
L278277 +++$+++ u5835 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ "This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
L278276 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
L278275 +++$+++ u5835 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
L278157 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
L278156 +++$+++ u5830 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOAN +++$+++ Reporters don't have hormones?
L278155 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
L278154 +++$+++ u5830 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOAN +++$+++ You didn't... get it on with him?
L278153 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ He's pretty... remarkable.
L278152 +++$+++ u5830 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOAN +++$+++ Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
L277998 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
L277997 +++$+++ u5830 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ JOAN +++$+++ There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
L278099 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
L278098 +++$+++ u5832 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
L278097 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Who?
L278096 +++$+++ u5832 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
L278064 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
L278063 +++$+++ u5832 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I didn't ask him.
L278062 +++$+++ u5829 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What about?
L278061 +++$+++ u5832 +++$+++ m386 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
