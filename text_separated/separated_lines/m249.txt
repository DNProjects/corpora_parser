L51892 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
L51614 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I love you.
L51613 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Call me as soon as you're settled.
L51611 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Well, maybe he has nice friends.
L51610 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
L51609 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ How was it talking to him?
L51525 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ I want us to go out.
L51524 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What is it you want? What?
L51523 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
L51522 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
L51521 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ ... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
L51520 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Go ahead.
L51519 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
L51517 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
L51516 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
L51515 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
L51514 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
L51513 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
L51512 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ You're not still writing that thank-you note?
L51451 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
L51450 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ It lets a crazy man into our lives.
L51449 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
L51448 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
L51403 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ You met the gift.
L51402 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Huh?
L51401 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ I didn't know you had a secret admire.
L51531 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L51530 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Do you love me?
L51405 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stay out of this...  Doctor?
L51404 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
L51400 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
L51399 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
L51181 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ Not bad.
L51180 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Don't be silly. How bad?
L51179 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L51435 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
L51434 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
L51432 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No.
L51431 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
L51430 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
L51429 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ His home number.
L51428 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Me. My home number is on this card.
L51427 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
L51426 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
L51425 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
L51424 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ It's amazing these things weren't done.
L51423 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
L51422 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
L51421 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No.
L51420 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Have they done skin testing for allergies?
L51419 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Emergency room only.
L51418 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
L51417 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes.
L51416 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Have they done blood tests on him?
L51415 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Since forever.
L51414 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ How long has he been having problems?
L51407 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm a waitress.
L51406 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
L51398 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
L51397 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
L51396 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
L51395 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
L51394 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
L51910 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
L51909 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
L51907 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
L51906 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You know what? I...
L51905 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
L51904 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
L51903 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
L51901 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay.
L51900 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
L51899 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
L51898 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
L51896 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
L51895 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
L51894 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Boyfriend?
L51890 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
L51889 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Because...
L51888 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I had to see you...
L51887 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Is it a secret what you're doing here?
L51886 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What a break...
L51885 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I wasn't asleep!!
L51883 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L51882 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Were you asleep?
L51881 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What job?
L51880 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
L51879 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Grouchy?
L51878 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
L51877 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What do you want?
L51876 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Were you asleep?
L51875 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What do you want, Melvin?
L51853 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ So long.
L51852 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay. Good-bye.
L51851 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I should've danced with you.
L51850 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Go ahead.
L51849 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay to say something now?
L51847 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
L51846 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Cute.
L51845 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
L51844 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ The two might go together.
L51843 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
L51842 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That seems like a good choice.
L51841 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I can trust my brain.
L51840 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How you doing?
L51839 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yeah... Well...
L51838 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hello.
L51813 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
L51812 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'll take you... why not?
L51811 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'll take a bus.
L51810 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
L51809 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
L51808 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ This one has a special meaning.
L51807 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't.
L51806 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What do you mean? You said you liked it.
L51805 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't want to hear that music right now.
L51801 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
L51800 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
L51799 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
L51783 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ To hell with sex.
L51782 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
L51751 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It was a mistake.
L51750 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'll never forget you said it.
L51749 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
L51748 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
L51747 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It's one idea...
L51746 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Sex with Simon?
L51745 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
L51744 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
L51743 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
L51742 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, ah... that's a personal question.
L51741 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
L51740 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You don't owe me that.
L51739 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Here's the trouble with never.
L51738 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Never.
L51737 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
L51736 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
L51735 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
L51734 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
L51733 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
L51731 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
L51730 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
L51729 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
L51726 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ One baked -- one fries.
L51725 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Fries.
L51724 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
L51723 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Can we order first?
L51722 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ And mean it...
L51721 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay.
L51720 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
L51719 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
L51718 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
L51717 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
L51716 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
L51715 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ And?
L51714 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
L51713 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You wanna dance?
L51694 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
L51693 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
L51689 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
L51688 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stop asking everyone.
L51676 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Dancing?
L51675 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
L51667 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
L51666 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
L51662 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No.
L51661 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
L51658 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
L51657 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ ... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
L51654 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You like sad stories -- you want mine.
L51653 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Hey -- you let him...
L51645 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
L51644 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Nonsense!
L51643 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
L51636 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Welcome.
L51635 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Thanks, Melvin.
L51631 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
L51630 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
L51629 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
L51628 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I was going to do that for you.
L51625 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
L51624 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
L51623 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Hi.
L51608 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
L51607 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Whether crabs are in season there now...
L51606 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
L51605 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
L51604 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
L51603 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
L51602 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
L51601 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes.
L51600 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Are you still coming?
L51599 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Hello?
L51595 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No.
L51594 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Is there another way to see it?
L51593 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
L51592 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
L51591 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
L51590 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's that got to do with it?
L51589 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Melvin, I'd rather not.
L51588 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
L51587 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ My son.
L51586 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You take off when you have to.
L51585 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I can't. I work.
L51584 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Two days.
L51583 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ The stiff one eye?
L51582 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
L51581 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No, sir...
L51580 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I want you to go on this trip.
L51579 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
L51578 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Now I want you to do something for me.
L51577 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Thank you.
L51576 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Nice of you... thank you.
L51574 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
L51573 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Lovely.
L51572 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
L51571 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No... no thank you notes.
L51570 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What you did changed my life.
L51569 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey, what I did for you is working out?
L51568 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay.
L51567 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
L51566 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ So. Anything else?
L51561 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
L51560 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
L51559 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Getting loud, getting loud.
L51543 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ A thank-you note for what you did for me.
L51542 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's this?
L51500 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes.
L51499 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ So you'll be at work?
L51498 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Just how grateful I am.
L51497 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
L51496 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm not kidding.
L51494 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
L51493 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What needs clearing up?
L51492 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
L51491 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
L51490 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
L51489 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
L51488 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Why did yo do this for me?
L51487 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Note. Put it in the note.
L51486 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
L51485 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
L51484 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
L51483 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes.
L51482 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Carol the waitress?
L51481 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Uh, Udall?
L51368 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No!!! Stay away from me!
L51367 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
L51354 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How ya doing?
L51353 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
L51352 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
L51351 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ How do you know about my mother?
L51350 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What about your mother?
L51349 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ My son is sick, okay?
L51348 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
L51347 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
L51346 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
L51345 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
L51344 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
L51343 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L51342 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
L51294 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You all set here?
L51293 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
L51290 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's with the dark?
L51289 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
L51288 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Otherwise, you're not ugly.
L51287 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
L51286 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
L51285 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Oh, please...
L51284 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How old are you?
L51283 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
L51282 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It's okay -- I'll sit here.
L51281 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Sorry.
L51280 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
L51279 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You're not worried that someone might take him?
L51278 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
L51277 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ So what are you doing with a dog?
L51226 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Spence.
L51225 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay.
L51224 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Spencer.
L51223 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ His name?
L51222 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
L51221 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No.
L51220 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
L51219 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What do you care?
L51218 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's wrong with your son, anyway?
L51217 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
L51216 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I see the help -- judgement call.
L51215 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
L51214 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay.
L51213 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
L51168 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
L51167 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
L51166 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
L51159 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
L51158 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I've got Jews at my table.
L51157 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I know. He's just the best.
L51153 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Will you please take it?
L51152 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm starving.
L51815 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Don't want to. I love you.
L51814 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I love you...  Let him take you home.
L51796 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You think you're kidding.
L51795 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ One night with me!
L51792 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'll take care of myself --
L51791 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ But what about...
L51785 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I just love her.  How're you doing?
L51784 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
L51777 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ All right, cut me a break.
L51776 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
L51775 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
L51774 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
L51773 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stop staring. Do a vase.
L51772 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
L51771 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
L51770 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I've got to sketch you.
L51768 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Good night.
L51767 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Good night.
L51766 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
L51765 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ How to die, mostly.
L51764 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Why? What have you been thinking about?
L51763 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
L51762 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm sorry... are you okay?
L51761 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Uh-huh...
L51760 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
L51759 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No!!!
L51758 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
L51757 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Can you not be violent?
L51756 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
L51755 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Was this supposed to be your room?
L51680 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What a nice compliment.
L51679 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
L51678 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
L51649 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
L51648 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well...
L51647 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes. I really would.
L51646 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
L51641 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
L51640 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
L51335 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
L51334 +++$+++ u3778 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CHERYL +++$+++ What the heck do you mean?
L51333 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What are you trying to do to me?
L51332 +++$+++ u3778 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CHERYL +++$+++ I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
L51331 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No. No. Get Carol.
L51330 +++$+++ u3778 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CHERYL +++$+++ What the heck are those for?
L51328 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Yes.  No.
L51327 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
L51326 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
L51325 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Two years ago...
L51324 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You changed the room around...
L51323 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
L51322 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
L51321 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
L51320 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
L51319 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
L51318 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Help!
L51621 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ So am I, Frank.
L51620 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
L51274 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
L51273 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
L51272 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
L51271 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
L51270 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
L51269 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
L51266 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
L51265 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
L51135 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
L51134 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
L51565 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Last word freak.
L51564 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
L51563 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
L51558 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
L51557 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
L51556 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Think white and get serious.
L51555 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
L51554 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
L51553 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
L51552 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
L51551 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
L51550 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ About a dog.
L51549 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey -- you called me... I...
L51548 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ "What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
L51547 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L51546 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
L51545 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
L51544 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's nice.
L51540 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do it.
L51539 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
L51538 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sure -- take him to the vet.
L51537 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
L51307 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay by me.
L51306 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
L51305 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
L51304 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
L51303 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ He's a pain in the ass.
L51302 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How's Verdell doing?
L51255 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
L51254 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
L51253 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thanks for looking after him.
L51252 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm not saying nothing to you.
L51251 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
L51140 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
L51139 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
L51138 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
L51137 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No touch. No touch. No touch.
L51104 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hope you find him. I love that dog.
L51103 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
L51101 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
L51100 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Simon, you've got to get dressed.
L51709 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
L51708 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ Shall I get her for you?
L51696 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Wait here.
L51695 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ Actually, I don't think so.
L51692 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
L51691 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What?
L51690 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
L51687 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hi. You have hard shells, right?
L51686 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ Good evening.
L51378 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
L51377 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
L51375 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well, I can't reach them.
L51374 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
L51373 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
L51372 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Terrify me?
L51371 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
L51370 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Sorry. What are those cards?
L51315 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You little stinker. He's given you everything.
L51314 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No. Please, don't force him.
L51263 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
L51262 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How you doing, great one?
L51447 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
L51446 +++$+++ u3785 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
L51445 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Sure thing.
L51444 +++$+++ u3785 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
L51443 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Absolutely.
L51442 +++$+++ u3785 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
L51441 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Is he dead yet?
L51245 +++$+++ u3786 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
L51244 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Ask him.
L51243 +++$+++ u3786 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Oh, is he dead?
L51242 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Just move on. No one here killed him.
L51241 +++$+++ u3786 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L51240 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
L51239 +++$+++ u3786 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
L51873 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I forgot to lock the door.
L51872 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ What's wrong?
L51871 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
L51870 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
L51869 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
L51868 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
L51867 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L51866 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ But you know where you're lucky?
L51865 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
L51864 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Picking on me won't help.
L51863 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
L51862 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Did you like it that much?
L51861 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
L51860 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
L51859 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
L51858 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Because...  ... you love her?
L51857 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
L51856 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ What did she say?
L51855 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'm coming.
L51854 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You going to come talk to me or not?
L51831 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Look, we both want the dog -- and...
L51830 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
L51826 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I love you.
L51825 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
L51824 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
L51820 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L51819 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I think you gotta camp it here...
L51818 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
L51817 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I told you to go on in.
L51804 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Does it matter?
L51803 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Another place where?
L51802 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
L51794 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
L51793 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What are you talking about? You got real problems.
L51790 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'm going back with you.
L51789 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ ... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
L51788 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ ... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
L51787 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
L51674 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I give you that one...  Nice packing.
L51673 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You consider your life easy.
L51672 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
L51671 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Melvin...
L51670 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
L51664 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
L51663 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Not it at all, really.
L51652 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ This stuff is pointless.
L51651 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
L51633 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Never a break. Never.
L51632 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That's very thoughtful.
L51627 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
L51626 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
L51509 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yeah...
L51508 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
L51507 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
L51506 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Got any easier questions?
L51505 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
L51504 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thanks.
L51503 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I brought you Chinese soup.
L51479 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
L51478 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Would you leave now, please?
L51477 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yo, yo, yo...
L51476 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Come on, sweetheart...
L51475 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Now we'll both call him.
L51474 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Oh, my gosh.
L51473 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I carry bacon in my pocket.
L51472 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.
L51471 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Get out.
L51470 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
L51467 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
L51466 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Rot in hell, Melvin.
L51465 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
L51464 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
L51463 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Get out.
L51462 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Where are all your queer party friends?
L51461 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Please, just leave.
L51460 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That cleaning woman doesn't...
L51459 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Go away.
L51458 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It smells like shit in here?
L51457 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
L51456 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thank you for walking him.
L51455 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
L51312 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Verdell?
L51311 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
L51310 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
L51309 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
L51308 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
L51132 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay, then.
L51131 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
L51130 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
L51129 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
L51128 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
L51127 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L51126 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Do you realize that I work at him?
L51125 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Did you... do something to him?
L51124 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, that's a load off.
L51123 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
L51122 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Maybe this can wait.
L51121 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yeeeess!!!
L51119 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ 'Love was... '
L51118 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
L51099 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
L51098 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How're you doing?
L51097 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
L51096 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
L51095 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Which color was that?
L51094 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
L51093 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
L51092 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's he look like?
L51091 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
L51391 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
L51390 +++$+++ u3790 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ How do you write women so well?
L51389 +++$+++ u3790 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
L51388 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
L51387 +++$+++ u3790 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
L51386 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's it mean?
L51385 +++$+++ u3790 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
L51237 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
L51236 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L51233 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Please!! NO!!!
L51232 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Just a second -- he has to go.
L51231 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Wait -- I want to see the painting.
L51230 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
L51229 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ So you're practically finished, huh?
L51210 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
L51209 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
L51208 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
L51207 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
L51206 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Exactly what is your previous experience?
