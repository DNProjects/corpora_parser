L81597 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
L81596 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I love Eve very much.
L81595 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
L81594 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
L81593 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ In a day or two, yes.
L81592 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Will you be leaving now, Robert?
L81591 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Yes, I suppose that's true.
L81590 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
L81589 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... He's gone, Chauncey.
L81025 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, really?
L81024 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
L81023 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I would like to walk today.
L81022 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Robert.
L81021 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
L81020 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
L81019 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
L81018 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
L81017 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ He does, does he?
L81016 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
L81015 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Oh? You've heard?
L81014 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
L81013 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
L81012 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Robert.
L81011 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Were you going somewhere?
L81008 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hardly any, Robert.
L81007 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
L81006 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
L81005 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
L81004 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
L81003 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's fine today, Robert.
L81002 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
L80955 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I will.
L80954 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... And please call me Robert.
L80895 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I will.
L80894 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
L80893 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.
L80892 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
L80891 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
L80890 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
L80889 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L80888 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
L80887 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
L80886 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
L80885 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80884 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ An attorney?
L80883 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
L80882 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Thomas? Who's Thomas?
L80881 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
L80880 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
L80879 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Straight out?
L80878 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
L80877 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, fine.
L80876 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ You can pull your trousers up, now.
L80875 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L80874 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
L80873 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I think so, too.
L80872 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
L80871 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ But not for long...
L80870 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You were wrong, it did hurt.
L80869 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
L80868 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand. I've seen it done before.
L80867 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
L81573 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
L81572 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
L81571 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No more, Robert... No more needles...
L81315 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
L81314 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
L80982 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
L80981 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
L80972 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
L80971 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
L80938 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Of course! By kid-lawyers!
L80937 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
L80936 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
L81621 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
L81620 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
L81619 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
L81618 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
L81617 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I wish he were here...
L81616 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I don't think so, he should be along soon...
L81615 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Do you think we should look for him?
L81610 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
L81609 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... He walked off...
L81165 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
L81164 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... But he's...?
L81163 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
L80906 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ No, Eve... I'm sorry.
L80905 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
L80904 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
L80903 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
L80902 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
L80901 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
L80900 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
L80899 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Stay here? Is that necessary?
L80898 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
L80897 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
L80896 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
L81478 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Certainly, glad to be of help.
L81477 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
L81476 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Of course, Doctor, I understand.
L81475 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
L81474 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
L81473 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
L81472 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
L81471 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I have no idea...
L81470 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
L81553 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
L81552 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
L81551 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
L81550 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
L81547 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
L81546 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
L81545 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
L80929 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
L80928 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
L80922 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
L80921 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ A Black man gave me the message.
L80920 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L80919 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh. I have a message for him.
L80918 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ No sir, I don't believe I do.
L80917 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Do you know Raphael?
L81201 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I like this attic very much.
L81200 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
L81199 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I would like to be on that show.
L81198 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
L81197 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I have seen that show on television.
L81196 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
L81195 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L81194 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
L81169 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81168 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Would you care to take it, sir?
L81167 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L81166 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
L81628 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
L81627 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
L81625 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Eve.
L81624 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey! Chauncey!
L81577 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ That's very interesting, Eve.
L81576 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
L81567 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
L81566 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's very good, Eve.
L81565 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
L81564 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like to watch.
L81563 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ To watch...? To watch me...?
L81562 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like to watch.
L81561 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
L81557 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L81556 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
L81555 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
L81554 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
L81542 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
L81541 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
L81540 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
L81539 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
L81538 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
L81387 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Dennis.
L81386 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
L81385 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81381 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Eve.
L81380 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
L81359 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
L81358 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. That could be true.
L81357 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
L81356 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
L81355 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
L81354 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. I know that.
L81353 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
L81352 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Eve. I like you to be here.
L81351 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
L81350 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like the President. He is a very nice man.
L81349 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
L81348 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
L81347 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
L81328 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good night, Eve.
L81327 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Good night, Chauncey.
L81326 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
L81325 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L81324 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
L81323 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, thank you.
L81322 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
L81219 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
L81218 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ That's good. I like to watch, too.
L81217 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
L81216 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ How is Ben feeling?
L81215 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
L81214 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Eve.
L81213 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
L81212 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Eve.
L81211 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey...
L81171 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
L81170 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
L81162 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ So am I, Eve.
L81161 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
L81156 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes, so do we.
L81155 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, I like that very much.
L81154 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Our greenhouse.
L81153 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ What is that?
L81152 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Of course.
L81151 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
L81150 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
L81149 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
L81148 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
L81147 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I was.
L81146 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
L81145 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Mentor...?
L81144 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
L81143 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
L81142 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
L81141 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81140 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
L81139 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
L81138 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Fine. He's very nice.
L81137 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
L81136 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's feeling much better now.
L81135 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Your leg must be getting better.
L81134 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Eve.
L81133 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey!
L80998 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good night, Eve.
L80997 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Good night, Chauncey.
L80996 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ That's good.
L80995 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Why... No, I don't think so...
L80994 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
L80993 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He does...?
L80992 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
L80991 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes... I know, Chauncey.
L80990 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
L80989 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
L80988 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
L80987 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
L80961 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I am a very good gardener.
L80960 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
L80950 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I like it here.
L80949 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
L80942 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
L80941 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
L80940 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. It won't do that.
L80939 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
L80836 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
L80835 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80834 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
L80833 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like to watch. This is fine.
L80832 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
L80831 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
L80830 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I lost my remote control.
L80829 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Did you lose something?
L80828 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
L80827 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
L80826 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
L80825 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I'm a gardener.
L80824 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
L80823 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ My name is Chance.
L80822 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ May I ask your name?
L80821 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Eve.
L80820 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
L80819 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh? Certainly...
L80818 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I would like to watch television.
L80817 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Thank you.
L80816 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Would you care for a drink?
L80814 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
L80813 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I agree.
L80812 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
L80811 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Your family doctor?
L80810 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
L80809 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
L80808 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
L80807 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. He's a very careful driver.
L80806 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
L80805 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I am.
L80804 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I hope you're comfortable.
L80793 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
L80792 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ There's no need for a hospital.
L80791 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
L81185 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I have nothing more to say.
L81184 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
L81183 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
L81182 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
L81181 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
L81180 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
L81179 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
L81178 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
L81177 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I'm not busy.
L81176 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
L81175 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Sid.
L81174 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
L81230 +++$+++ u4002 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HULL +++$+++ I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
L81229 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's a very good show.
L81228 +++$+++ u4002 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HULL +++$+++ Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
L81227 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L81226 +++$+++ u4002 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HULL +++$+++ Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
L81225 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Morton.
L81224 +++$+++ u4002 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HULL +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
L81525 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ Your foot! Give me your foot!!
L81524 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L81523 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ I don't want Robert.
L81522 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
L81521 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ Really? Really!!!
L81520 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I do, it's very good.
L81519 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ ... Are you sure you like it?
L81518 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
L81517 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ Do you like it?
L81516 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, very well, thank you.
L81515 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ Can you see well?
L81453 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L81452 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
L81451 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. That would be good.
L81448 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
L81447 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like that name very much.
L81446 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
L81445 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
L81444 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Yes, it is very good!
L81443 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, good.
L81442 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
L81441 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ So you know Krylov!
L81440 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Do you think so? Do you think so?
L81439 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
L81438 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I certainly do.
L81437 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
L81436 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
L81435 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
L81434 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
L81433 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
L81432 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I agree, I think so too.
L81431 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ ... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
L81430 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
L81429 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Ben is very ill.
L81428 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
L81426 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
L81425 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
L81419 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
L81418 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I agree.
L81417 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
L81588 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
L81587 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I would like to do that.
L81586 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
L81585 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ A flower...
L81584 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
L81583 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, I see.
L81582 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
L81581 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
L81580 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Chauncey... Chauncey...
L81319 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
L81318 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
L81317 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
L81316 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Certainly, Ben.
L81131 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
L81130 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Ben.
L81129 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
L81128 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand.
L81127 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
L81126 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Ben.
L81125 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
L81120 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
L81119 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
L81118 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben - he is.
L81117 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
L81102 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. That is correct.
L81101 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
L81048 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
L81047 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see, Ben.
L81046 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
L81040 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
L81039 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
L81038 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand.
L81037 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
L81036 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You're looking much better today, Ben.
L81035 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Well, that's good news, my boy.
L81034 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
L81033 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
L80980 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
L80979 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
L80978 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
L80977 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Ben.
L80968 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
L80967 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
L80966 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
L80965 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
L80964 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Bravo!
L80963 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
L80962 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
L80959 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see. I would like to work in your garden.
L80958 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
L80953 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ And I'm Ben.
L80952 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Chauncey is fine.
L80951 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
L80948 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
L80947 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
L80946 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
L80945 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, thank you. My house has been closed.
L80935 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... So am I, my boy - so am I.
L80934 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I am very hungry.
L80933 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
L80932 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I agree.
L80931 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
L80925 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. You look very sick.
L80924 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
L80915 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like that very much.
L80914 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
L80913 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I feel very good in here.
L80912 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... I see.
L80911 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
L81503 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
L81502 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81501 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
L81500 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I want to tell Eve.
L81499 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
L81498 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like to watch very much.
L81497 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
L81496 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like to watch.
L81495 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
L81488 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ What sort of bed is it?
L81487 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
L81486 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like to watch.
L81485 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
L81484 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I can't read.
L81483 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
L81482 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I can't write.
L81481 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
L81480 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Ronald.
L81479 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
L81032 +++$+++ u4014 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
L81031 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I would like to see Ben.
L81030 +++$+++ u4014 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ ... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
L81029 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81028 +++$+++ u4014 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ ... Sir?
L81027 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
L81026 +++$+++ u4014 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
L80757 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good day, Sally.
L80756 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Good day, Mr. Chance.
L80737 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I have seen styles on television.
L80736 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
L80735 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
L80727 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
L80726 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
L80722 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.
L80721 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
L80712 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... Oh.
L80711 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Of men and women.
L80710 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Some pictures...?
L80701 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I never needed money.
L80700 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ What about money?
L80693 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh. Thank you.
L80692 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
L80691 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80690 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... Then you really are a gardener?
L80673 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80672 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
L80803 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
L80802 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... My suitcase.
L80801 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Very good.
L80800 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Yes. You can take me.
L80799 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
L80798 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I've never ridden in an automobile.
L80797 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Please, sir.
L80790 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80789 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It's starting to swell, is it painful?
L80788 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Of course. I would like to look.
L80787 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Let's have a look, do you mind?
L80786 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I agree.
L80785 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
L80781 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's very sore.
L80780 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
L80779 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
L80778 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
L80986 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ ... Yes sir - elevator!
L80985 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Hmmm... Elevator.
L80910 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It seems to be.
L80909 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
L80908 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... That is a very small room.
L80851 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
L80850 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ How long do we stay in here?
L80849 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L80848 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
L80847 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Does it have a television?
L80661 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
L80660 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80659 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ ... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
L80657 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I'm going to work in the garden.
L80656 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
L80655 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I'm very hungry.
L80654 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
L80653 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It is.
L80652 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Well, ain't that the truth...
L80651 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
L80650 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
L80649 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
L80648 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
L80647 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I've seen that done.
L80646 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
L80645 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... I see.
L80644 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
L80643 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good morning, Louise.
L80641 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Is his back feeling better?
L80640 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ ... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
L80639 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
L80638 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L80637 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ ... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
L80636 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Good evening, Louise.
L80635 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ ... Evening, Chance.
L81286 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I am a very serious gardener.
L81285 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
L81284 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L81283 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
L81269 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. We need a very good gardener.
L81268 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
L81254 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
L81253 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
L81252 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81251 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
L81250 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I was there with Ben.
L81249 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
L81248 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Which view?
L81247 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
L81246 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I don't object.
L81245 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
L81244 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I hope so.
L81243 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ ... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
L81242 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. That is surprising.
L81241 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
L81240 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You're welcome.
L81239 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
L81238 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81237 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
L80755 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
L80754 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
L80753 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
L80752 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Correct.
L80751 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ But you won't sign, correct?
L80750 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I have no claim, Thomas.
L80749 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Come now, Mr. Chance.
L80748 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
L80747 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
L80746 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
L80745 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
L80739 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I would like to stay and work in my garden.
L80738 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
L80734 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
L80733 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
L80732 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
L80729 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
L80728 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
L80725 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
L80724 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
L80723 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
L80720 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
L80719 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Have you served in the Army?
L80718 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
L80717 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
L80716 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
L80715 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
L80714 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
L80713 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
L80709 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
L80708 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ 1952...?
L80707 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
L80706 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... Joe? Who's Joe?
L80705 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
L80704 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
L80703 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, I do not have any of those.
L80702 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
L80699 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I was given meals, and a home...
L80698 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ How were you paid?
L80697 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Compensated...?
L80696 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
L80695 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.
L80694 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
L80689 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
L80688 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Since you were a child?
L80687 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
L80686 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... How long have you been living here?
L80685 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
L80684 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
L80683 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I live here.
L80682 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
L80681 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see...
L80680 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
L80679 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
L80678 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
L80677 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
L80676 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
L80675 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Thomas - I understand.
L80674 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
L80671 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
L80670 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
L81108 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
L81107 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I will.
L81106 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
L81105 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It has.
L81100 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
L81099 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
L81098 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... In the garden?
L81097 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
L81096 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
L81080 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
L81079 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I will.
L81078 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
L81076 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Oh, really...
L81075 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
L81072 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Hello.
L81071 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. President.
L81308 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I said - try again.
L81307 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ Sid, it's useless!
L81306 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Try again.
L81305 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
L81304 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Try again.
L81303 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ ... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
L81223 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
L81222 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
L81221 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ ... Nothing.
L81220 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ ... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
L81321 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
L81320 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Ben, really...
L81282 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ That's good... That's good.
L81281 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Yes, I am, Ben.
L81280 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
L80944 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Do you need a secretary?
L80943 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
L80863 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
L80862 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Do you feel well enough for that?
L80861 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
L80860 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
L80859 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
L80858 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You heard?
L80857 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
L80856 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No headaches?
L80855 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
L80854 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
L80843 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
L80842 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L80841 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
L80840 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
L80839 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
L80838 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good evening, Wilson.
L80837 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
L81424 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Would you two excuse me for a moment?
L81423 +++$+++ u4015 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
L81395 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
L81394 +++$+++ u4015 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
L81393 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
L81392 +++$+++ u4015 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ And look who you brought with!
L81391 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Hello, Sophie.
L81390 +++$+++ u4015 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
L81612 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
L81611 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I can certainly understand that...
L81509 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ It's not that, I just...
L81508 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
L81507 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
L81506 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ ... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
L81505 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ No, that won't do any good.
L81504 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ ... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
L81403 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
L81402 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
L81401 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
L81400 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
L81399 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... How are the kids getting along?
L80744 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
L80743 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
L80742 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... Yeah...
L80741 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
L80740 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... What do you make of all this?
L80668 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
L80667 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... Would you take me on a tour?
L80666 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
L80665 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
L81293 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ I said good night!
L81292 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Look, Johanna...
L81291 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ Good night.
L81290 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
L81289 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ ... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
L81264 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
L81263 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ No! He's a real gardener!
L81262 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
L81261 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ It's that gardener!
L81465 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ Very good, Your Excellency.
L81464 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
L81463 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ Clearly, yes comrade.
L81462 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
L81461 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
L81460 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
L81459 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
L81458 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
L81457 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
L81456 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
L81455 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
L81454 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Yes? What have you found?
L81409 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
L81408 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Good. Anything else?
L81407 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
L81406 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Oh? What?
L81405 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
L81345 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I would appreciate that.
L81344 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
L81343 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... So what does all that add up to?
L81340 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L81339 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
L81338 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
L81337 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
L81336 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
L81335 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ So...? Where the hell is it?
L81334 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Right, Chief.
L81333 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
L81332 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L81331 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ This is not what I requested.
L81207 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Right, Chief.
L81206 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
L81205 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
L81204 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
L81203 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
L81202 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
L81124 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ No problem, Chief.
L81123 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
L81122 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Gardiner, yes, sir.
L81121 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
L81536 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ Let us toast to the success of the coup.
L81535 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Thank you, Colonel.
L81534 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
L81533 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
L81532 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
L81531 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
L81530 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
L81529 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ That could be possible...
L81528 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
L81116 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner...
L81115 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ You take care too, Bobby.
L81114 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Take care of yourself, Ben.
L81113 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
L81112 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
L81111 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
L81110 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
L81109 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
L81095 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I'm afraid so.
L81094 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ It's that serious, huh?
L81093 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
L81088 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
L81087 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
L81086 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, Ben... I...
L81085 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
L81084 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Well?
L81083 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L81082 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
L81074 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
L81073 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
L81070 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
L81069 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
L81068 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
L81067 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Mr. President, how good to see you.
L81066 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Ben!
