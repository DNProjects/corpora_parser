L480092 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes.
L479933 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
L479932 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Right.
L479729 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
L479728 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
L479727 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm not running.
L479726 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
L479725 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You don't understand this guy.
L479724 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
L479723 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
L479719 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
L479718 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
L479716 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Ike just came by to check out the team.
L479715 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What is he up to now?
L480192 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Maintain eye contact.
L480191 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Got any last minute advice?
L480190 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
L480189 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Really?
L480187 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Thank you.
L480186 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You look awful.
L480126 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
L480125 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What do you expect me to say to this?
L480116 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
L480115 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
L479722 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You bet ya, Coach.
L479721 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ See you at the wedding.
L479675 +++$+++ u7360 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
L479674 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Ahh.
L479762 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Of course.
L479761 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
L479760 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Of course.
L479759 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
L479758 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
L479756 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
L479755 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
L479753 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ God bless you, Maggie.
L479752 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
L479751 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ It happens to be how I feel.
L479750 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Good one!  Thanks.
L479749 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
L479748 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ And what did you say?
L479747 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
L479743 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What did he ask?
L479742 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
L479741 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
L479740 +++$+++ u7361 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
L480171 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ He's here!... He's here!
L480170 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'll get the dress.
L480168 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ We'll rub.
L480167 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's hurting.
L480166 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ We do it to our dog.
L480163 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
L480162 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ And in a "V".
L479579 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
L479578 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That's it.  Back to obedience school.
L480165 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
L480164 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Rub your ears.
L480150 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ His hair... any color.
L480149 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
L480112 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ "Never say die."
L480111 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ "Nothing but net."
L480110 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ "Make the shot."
L480109 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ "Sink the putt."
L480108 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
L480107 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Bob's in a hurry.
L480096 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
L480095 +++$+++ u7362 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
L480226 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Where do you think she's going?
L480225 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Maggie!
L480030 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
L480029 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
L480028 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No.  No, you didn't.
L480027 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
L480024 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
L480023 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Fisher, let him talk.
L479554 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
L479553 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
L479552 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I already made an appointment for later today.
L479551 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
L479549 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
L479548 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No, that's what makes you unemployed.
L479545 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
L479544 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
L479543 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
L479542 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
L479541 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
L479540 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ What?
L479539 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ -- It's for you, Ike.
L479536 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
L479535 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
L479534 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
L480224 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Poor Ike.
L480223 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Look, he's in pretty good shape.
L480222 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Look, he's running after her.
L480020 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
L480019 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Or a vegetarian?
L480018 +++$+++ u7363 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
L480017 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
L480196 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
L480195 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
L480194 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I have no idea what I'm doing.
L480184 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
L480183 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
L480182 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Then you'll be my best man.
L480181 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Of course we are.  Of course.
L480022 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
L480021 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
L479993 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
L479992 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Okay, we'll order out.
L479991 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Then come for dinner.
L479990 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Yeah.
L479989 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ You're coming here?
L479988 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
L479987 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't know.
L479986 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
L479985 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
L479984 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
L479575 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
L479574 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
L479572 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ But I'll get my normal fee, right?
L479571 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
L479570 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ "Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
L479569 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
L479568 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
L479567 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
L479566 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
L479565 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
L479564 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
L479563 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ All the gory details.
L479562 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ The real story on Miss Carpenter.
L479561 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
L479560 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
L479559 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
L479547 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
L479546 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ In vino veritas.
L479538 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
L479537 +++$+++ u7364 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
L480013 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Oh, please!
L480012 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Unbelievable, she got to you.
L480011 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
L480010 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And you defending her?
L480009 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
L480008 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why do YOU think she ran?
L480007 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't think that's why she ran.
L480006 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
L480004 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Neuter a locust, feed the world.
L480003 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
L480002 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
L480001 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
L480000 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
L479999 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's a cacophony of contradictions.
L479998 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Thanks.
L479997 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
L479996 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You could have told me you were fiance number three.
L479995 +++$+++ u7365 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
L479994 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Get this man a Kamikaze.
L480179 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No, I'm not.
L480178 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
L479937 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ Tootaloo.
L479936 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
L479612 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ Oh, I will.
L479611 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
L479610 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
L479608 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
L479607 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
L479606 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
L479605 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
L479604 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Sorry, no.  I just got one.
L479807 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
L479806 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ It's nice that they're still friends.
L479804 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ That must have made you proud.
L479803 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
L479802 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
L479801 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
L479626 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, she's talking about your hair.
L479625 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I think you'd look good in red.
L479596 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
L479595 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Looking for Maggie.
L479594 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ And you are?
L479590 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
L479589 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
L479588 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
L479587 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ About her upcoming wedding and all.
L479586 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
L479585 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ What?
L479584 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Are you a reporter?
L479583 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
L480199 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
L480198 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Thank you.
L480197 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
L479710 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
L479709 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ Your two cinnamon rolls.
L479699 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ -- The luau for Maggie.
L479698 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
L479697 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
L479696 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Yes, I am.  And who are you?
L479666 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
L479665 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
L479661 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
L479660 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Like her mother.
L479657 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You know, your daughter seems...
L479656 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
L479655 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
L479649 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
L479648 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ They made me put my hat back on.
L480288 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
L480287 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Pretty good speech, Maggie.
L480286 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ "I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
L480285 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm listening.
L480284 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
L480283 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You were not.
L480277 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ This is getting serious.
L480276 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
L480275 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Used?
L480270 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
L480269 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L480268 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
L480267 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Does it matter?
L480266 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
L480265 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
L480264 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's something I've always wanted to do.
L480263 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
L480261 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
L480260 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
L480145 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ So, we'll...
L480144 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ So am I.
L480143 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm okay with that.
L480142 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
L480141 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ And the church.
L480140 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well, you do have the dress.
L480139 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes, you!
L480138 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Me?
L480137 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ To who?  Are you asking me?
L480135 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I love you, too.
L480134 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I love you.  I love you.
L480133 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Me, either.
L480132 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
L480131 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
L480124 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Really?
L480123 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ A little longer for me.
L480122 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ About a minute...?
L480120 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I kissed him back.
L480119 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
L480100 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
L480099 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'd rather not.
L480098 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
L480089 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
L480088 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes I do!
L480087 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
L480086 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ That's called changing your mind.
L480085 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
L480084 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What!?
L480083 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
L480082 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Lost!
L480081 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
L480080 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
L480079 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
L480078 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Brian told you that?
L480077 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
L480076 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I already explained about that.
L480075 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
L480074 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ That was very interesting research George was doing!
L480073 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Or the sexual habits of locusts?
L480072 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's fun!  It's high.
L480071 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
L480070 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
L480069 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
L480068 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You humiliated me!
L480067 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
L480057 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't and I don't think you should...
L480056 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes.
L480055 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
L480054 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L480053 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
L480044 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Missed me bad, huh?
L480043 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Where did you disappear to?
L479979 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
L479978 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
L479973 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
L479972 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Kind of isolated.
L479971 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
L479970 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Of what?
L479969 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
L479968 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Can you fix it?
L479967 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
L479962 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
L479961 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
L479952 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
L479951 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
L479950 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No.  You take it.
L479949 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
L479948 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
L479947 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
L479940 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
L479939 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Ike... Hi, Grandma.
L479935 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You know, there's no...
L479934 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
L479930 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
L479929 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Of course.
L479928 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'll have the same.
L479923 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Bob will be very happy.
L479922 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
L479921 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You look... uh... You look fine.
L479898 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Agreed.
L479897 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
L479893 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
L479892 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No.
L479891 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You don't know.
L479890 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't know.
L479889 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
L479888 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
L479887 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ So?  Is that what you said to her?
L479886 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm a work in progress.
L479884 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
L479883 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
L479882 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Highly suspect.
L479881 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
L479879 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
L479878 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
L479877 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Still sweet.
L479876 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Always a mood killer.
L479874 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
L479873 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
L479872 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
L479871 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You afraid to try?
L479870 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Maybe someday.
L479869 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
L479868 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I think so.
L479865 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Cindy the manicurist.
L479864 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
L479862 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Done.
L479861 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Six-fifty.
L479860 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Five hundred.
L479859 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Seven-fifty.
L479858 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Too much.
L479857 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
L479856 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
L479855 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
L479854 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
L479852 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Really.
L479851 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
L479850 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
L479849 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
L479847 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
L479846 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
L479811 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
L479810 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
L479809 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You can turn that finger around.
L479808 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
L479783 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ He is not!
L479782 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
L479771 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
L479770 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Give me that!
L479701 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ A pre-wedding luau?
L479700 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
L479684 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
L479683 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ We think so.
L479682 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ How romantic.
L479680 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Without oxygen...
L479679 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Really?
L479678 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Twice...
L479677 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Everest.  Is that right?
L479672 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
L479671 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ That's fair.
L479642 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
L479641 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ We'll see.
L479640 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're going to be very disappointed.
L479639 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
L479638 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Did something happen to make you care about reality?
L479636 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You have one?
L479635 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
L479620 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes.
L479619 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
L479618 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
L479617 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Getting nervous?
L479614 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You'll answer my questions?
L479613 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
L479601 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Excellent.
L479600 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Originality is my speciality.
L479599 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
L480238 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Quick.  Very quick.
L480237 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thank you.  You still think that he was....
L480236 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
L480235 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L480234 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Okay.
L480233 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No, I'm just going to head home.
L480232 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
L480231 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm just finishing up, too.
L480230 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You okay?  I'm closing.
L480210 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
L480209 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Let's go.
L480161 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Not eight...
L480160 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
L480159 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
L480158 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
L480153 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
L480152 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Grandma!
L480106 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's for the bell.
L480105 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ ... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
L480104 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What happened at the luau?
L480103 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
L480102 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ He's going to be the pastor?
L480038 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Would it?
L480037 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
L480036 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
L480035 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Lighten up, what?
L480034 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Lighten up, wahine.
L479844 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
L479843 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
L479842 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
L479841 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
L479840 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
L479839 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
L479838 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
L479837 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
L479836 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ But I'm weird.
L479835 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
L479834 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
L479833 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
L479832 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
L479831 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Why?
L479830 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm going to kill myself.
L479828 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
L479827 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
L479825 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yes.
L479824 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
L479823 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
L479795 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
L479794 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
L479793 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Where?
L479792 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
L479791 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
L479790 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Ya think?
L479789 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's probably because you got him fired.
L479788 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
L479787 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
L479786 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
L479603 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ She's the boss.
L479602 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
L479598 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yup!
L479597 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Reporter?
L479582 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
L479581 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
L479580 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You're a goddess!
L479523 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
L479522 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
L480255 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
L480254 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ A harmless joke.
L480253 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No.  It's my life.
L480252 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Maggie, it's just a joke...
L480251 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
L480250 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What?
L480207 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thank you, Dad.
L480206 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm really rooting for this one.
L479958 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
L479957 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
L479956 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Good boy, Port Hole.
L479955 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
L479670 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Not this one.  This one's on me.
L479669 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
L479516 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
L479515 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yeah.
L479514 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
L479513 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No.
L479512 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ No, no.  You're her best friend.
L479511 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, you tell her.
L479510 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ You tell Maggie.
L479509 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ "And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
L479508 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ "What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
