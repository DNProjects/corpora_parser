L170015 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?

L170012 +++$+++ u4899 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ RADIO RAHEEM +++$+++ I don't like anything else.
L170011 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
L170010 +++$+++ u4899 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ RADIO RAHEEM +++$+++ You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
L170009 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Is that the only tape you got?
L170008 +++$+++ u4899 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ RADIO RAHEEM +++$+++ I be.  I'm living large.

L169593 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
L169592 +++$+++ u4888 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ I'm gonna leave now.
L169579 +++$+++ u4888 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
L169578 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
L169577 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
L169576 +++$+++ u4888 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ I own a brownstone on this block.
L169575 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
L169574 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ I'll fuck you up quick two times.
L169573 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me?"
L169572 +++$+++ u4888 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
L169571 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
L169570 +++$+++ u4888 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Yes?

L169801 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
L169800 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ So, in other words, you are not down.
L169799 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
L169798 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
L169797 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ Did you ask Sal?
L169796 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ And I--we--want some Black people up.
L169795 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ And?
L169794 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
L169789 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Have you noticed something about them?
L169788 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ So?
L169787 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
L169786 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ What did he do this time?
L169785 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
L169784 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
L170039 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
L170038 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
L170037 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa.
L170036 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
L170035 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
L170034 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
L170033 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
L169450 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
L169449 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Don't come back, either.
L169446 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You a troublemaker?
L169445 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
L169436 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Two dollars!  Forget it!
L169435 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
L169434 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
L169433 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
L169432 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ How much?
L169783 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
L169782 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
L169566 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
L169565 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ No, you the man.
L169564 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ You the man.
L169563 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ You the man.
L169453 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
L169452 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ I'm cool.  I'm cool.
L169451 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
L169441 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
L169440 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ Ask Sal.
L169439 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ How come you ain't got no brothers up?
L169438 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ What?
L169437 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Mookie.
L169847 +++$+++ u4895 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ ML +++$+++ I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
L169846 +++$+++ u4889 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ COCONUT SID +++$+++ Squash it.
L169836 +++$+++ u4889 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ COCONUT SID +++$+++ I don't know how he does it.
L169835 +++$+++ u4895 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ ML +++$+++ What can you say?
L169777 +++$+++ u4889 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ COCONUT SID +++$+++ No!
L169776 +++$+++ u4895 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ ML +++$+++ No!
L169627 +++$+++ u4895 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ ML +++$+++ Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
L169626 +++$+++ u4889 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ COCONUT SID +++$+++ How long?
L169624 +++$+++ u4895 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ ML +++$+++ A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
L169623 +++$+++ u4889 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ COCONUT SID +++$+++ It's been about a year.
L169618 +++$+++ u4895 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ ML +++$+++ OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
L169617 +++$+++ u4889 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ COCONUT SID +++$+++ Make it plain.
L169608 +++$+++ u4895 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ ML +++$+++ What was you saying?
L169607 +++$+++ u4889 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ COCONUT SID +++$+++ As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
L169425 +++$+++ u4895 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ ML +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
L169424 +++$+++ u4889 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ COCONUT SID +++$+++ You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
L170101 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ We're still standing.
L170100 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ I hope the block is still standing.
L170099 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ I didn't.
L170098 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Where did you sleep?
L170097 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ I've done that before.
L170096 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
L170095 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Is it a good morning?
L170094 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ Good morning.
L169915 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ You're welcome.
L169914 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ I thank you.
L169913 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
L169912 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
L169911 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
L169910 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
L169496 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
L169495 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
L169494 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
L169421 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
L169420 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
L169419 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
L169418 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ You're a drunk fool.
L169417 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
L169416 +++$+++ u4897 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOTHER SISTER +++$+++ The evil eye doesn't work on me.
L169466 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ That's it.
L169465 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ That's it?
L169464 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
L169463 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ OK.  OK.
L169462 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
L169461 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ C'mere, Doctor.
L169460 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ Gotta go.
L169459 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Mookie.
L169647 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ You got a deal.
L169646 +++$+++ u4891 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fifty cents.
L169645 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
L169644 +++$+++ u4891 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
L169643 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
L169642 +++$+++ u4891 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
L169641 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ What makes Sammy run?
L169640 +++$+++ u4891 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ My name is Eddie.
L169639 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ What makes Sammy run?
L169638 +++$+++ u4891 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Ten.
L169637 +++$+++ u4890 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ DA MAYOR +++$+++ How old are you?
L169636 +++$+++ u4891 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Eddie Lovell.
L169899 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
L169898 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
L169897 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ ...peanuts.

L169893 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
L169892 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ I might be, but you're not welcome here.
L169891 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ You are too crude.
L169890 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
L169889 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
L169888 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ Innocent!
L169887 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ He's completely innocent.
L169886 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ Nice!
L169885 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ He's just being nice.
L169884 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
L169883 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ What are you so worked up about?
L169882 +++$+++ u4896 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ MOOKIE +++$+++ No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
