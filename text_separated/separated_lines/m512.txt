L500708 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
L500707 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L500697 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
L500696 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Where do you think you'll go?
L500695 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's very kind of you to offer, but --
L500694 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ About the mail --
L500693 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, can't think of anything else that matters.
L500689 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
L500688 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah?
L500687 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
L500686 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Not at all.
L500685 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
L500684 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
L500683 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
L500682 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
L500681 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
L500680 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ So I gathered.
L500679 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
L500678 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
L500677 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
L500668 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Except the money.
L500667 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
L500666 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ They know.
L500665 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
L500664 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But they know.
L500594 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L500593 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
L500592 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
L500591 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
L500557 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L500556 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Your friends.
L500555 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Who?
L500553 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We just wanted to speak to you.
L500552 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
L500551 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Looking for you? Yes.
L500550 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You looking for me?
L500438 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
L500437 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I want to secure it.
L500429 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
L500428 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Not eating like you used to, that's what.
L500427 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Not eating what?
L500426 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're not eating.
L500425 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Nothing.
L500424 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's wrong?
L500423 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
L500422 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're sure? There's lots more.
L500421 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What? Yes, that's fine.
L500415 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, that'll come in useful.
L500414 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
L500413 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's all this for, more security?
L500412 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
L500411 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Doesn't it worry you?
L500410 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
L500409 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There was a break-in.
L500408 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
L500407 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Security.
L500406 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What is this?
L500396 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know.
L500395 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How much?
L500394 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know.
L500393 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How much did you pay?
L500392 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know.
L500391 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How much did you pay?
L500376 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You think so?
L500375 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
L500362 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
L500361 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
L500349 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ After.
L500348 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now.
L500347 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ After you drink to love and happiness forever.
L500346 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I want to talk now.
L500345 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's the problem?
L500342 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Just stop worrying.
L500341 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
L500340 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Not now. I have an idea.
L500339 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Can we talk about something?
L500338 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That was good.
L500316 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
L500315 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Is this necessary?
L500314 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't you worry about that.
L500313 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Is that going to be deep enough?
L500312 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But not quite.
L500311 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Finished.
L500308 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
L500307 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know.
L500301 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Take his legs.
L500300 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I just thought we should discuss it.
L500299 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
L500290 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
L500289 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
L500288 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I won't be able to.
L500287 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't hear this.
L500286 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I can't do it.
L500285 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
L500284 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You know what. Who's going to do it.
L500283 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
L500282 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about.
L500281 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Then what? Who's going to do what?
L500280 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, not that.
L500279 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dig the pit, I don't know.
L500278 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ So who's going to do it?
L500277 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
L500276 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
L500270 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ And what about you?
L500269 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You call them if you want.
L500268 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ When are you going to let the police know?
L500267 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He couldn't get his car started.
L500266 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ He's still here.
L500232 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
L500231 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You think so?
L500230 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
L500229 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
L500228 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm only asking you both to think about it.
L500227 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You mean immoral.
L500222 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Juliet?
L500221 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500220 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Come on, David.
L500219 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500218 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Think about it.
L500217 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500215 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Can I show you something?
L500214 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
L500172 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500171 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
L500170 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Alex, I don't have the time --
L500169 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Have you seen him?
L500168 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
L500144 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
L500143 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Only on expenses.
L500139 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why, thank you, David.
L500138 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ He made it clear.
L500114 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
L500113 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm only asking what you think.
L500112 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't have time.
L500111 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ About this guy, this Hugo person.
L500110 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ About what?
L500109 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What do you think?
L500049 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
L500048 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
L500047 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
L500046 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
L500041 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I haven't lost yet.
L500040 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're a bad loser.
L500039 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you shut up and play.
L500038 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Chess. Chess is often used as well.
L500037 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L500036 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ In the same fashion as chess.
L500035 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Just serve.
L500034 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I was trying to educate you.
L500033 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Serve.
L500032 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
L500026 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
L500025 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
L500020 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
L500019 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
L500014 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
L500013 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ All right, just a few questions.
L499986 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know -- Campbell or something?
L499985 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's his name?
L500574 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
L500573 +++$+++ u7578 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Don't know what?
L500572 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know.
L500571 +++$+++ u7578 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
L500570 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But there's no --
L500569 +++$+++ u7578 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Well?
L500568 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Cover it?
L500567 +++$+++ u7578 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
L500566 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know anything about it.
L500565 +++$+++ u7578 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
L500662 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
L500661 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Right.
L500660 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I see.
L500659 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
L500653 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes.
L500652 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Just one thing.
L500651 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
L500650 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Sorry to waste your time.
L500649 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's all?
L500648 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ That's it, then.
L500647 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
L500646 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Parked outside?
L500645 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What?
L500644 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, is it?
L500643 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, I suppose so.
L500642 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
L500641 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know them.
L500640 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Take another look at these two.
L500639 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I've never seen any of these men before.
L500638 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Well, then?
L500637 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No. Why should it?
L500636 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ That's because he is. Does that upset you?
L500635 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It looks like he's writing everything down.
L500634 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What does it look like?
L500633 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Are you recording it?
L500632 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ This is just an informal discussion.
L500631 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Is this being recorded?
L500360 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
L500359 +++$+++ u7575 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ What?
L500003 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
L500002 +++$+++ u7575 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Well, yes.
L500001 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
L500000 +++$+++ u7575 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Yes.
L499999 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
L499998 +++$+++ u7575 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Oh, yes, it's great.
L499997 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And you like it?
L499996 +++$+++ u7575 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Yes.
L499995 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
L499994 +++$+++ u7575 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Yes, thanks.
L499993 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
L499992 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L499991 +++$+++ u7575 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That's right.
L500711 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Let him go. Let him take it all.
L500710 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
L500605 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No.
L500604 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Don't you ever stop?
L500603 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
L500602 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ You mustn't take it so badly.
L500601 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The perfect couple, I should say.
L500600 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It's about me and David.
L500596 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's what I thought he said.
L500595 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It makes us feel a whole lot better.
L500590 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Oh, shut up, Alex.
L500589 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
L500585 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ We were just sorting things out.
L500584 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
L500583 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
L500582 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Are you all right?
L500532 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
L500531 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L500530 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Alex.
L500529 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
L500528 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Everything.
L500527 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
L500526 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I'll wait there.
L500525 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You'll wait in the hall?
L500490 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
L500489 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ You're frightened.
L500488 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I refuse.
L500487 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It's the only way.
L500486 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
L500475 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
L500474 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Aren't you going to answer it?
L500473 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh.
L500472 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No.
L500471 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Expecting anyone?
L500470 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Forget it -- he'll come down.
L500469 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Now you thought of that, not me.
L500468 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Where he can't get it?
L500467 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We could put it somewhere.
L500466 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ And the money?
L500465 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
L500464 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Forget it.
L500463 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He won't do anything for me, but for you --
L500462 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Oh, good.
L500461 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
L500460 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ David?
L500459 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Later. But first -- him.
L500458 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Your painful groin?
L500457 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We have to talk.
L500456 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L500455 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Boy, am I glad to see you.
L500451 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
L500450 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
L500449 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
L500448 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ He'll come down. Leave him alone.
L500447 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He can't stay up there.
L500446 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Leave him alone.
L500440 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
L500439 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I don't see the point in that.
L500436 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Don't you?
L500435 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You know we're right.
L500434 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Be like a weight off your shoulders.
L500433 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
L500432 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
L500431 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
L500420 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
L500419 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It tastes different.
L500418 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
L500417 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, no, it's different.
L500416 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Is this the same stuff you made last week?
L500390 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
L500389 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Will you calm down.
L500385 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Then let's spend some money.
L500384 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No.
L500383 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Are you all right?
L500382 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
L500381 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Who was it?
L500380 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Hello. Hello.
L500378 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You were magnificent.
L500377 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Well, you certainly had a good look around.
L500358 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
L500357 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ That's not him.
L500356 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's he doing here?
L500355 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No, I don't.
L500354 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Cameron. You remember Cameron.
L500353 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Who?
L500352 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Look over there. It's Cameron.
L500351 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
L500350 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
L500344 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ For ever and ever.
L500343 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Love and happiness for ever.
L500328 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I want my money back. Excuse me.
L500327 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Sshh.
L500324 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
L500323 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Stop nagging.
L500322 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
L500321 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Be careful.
L500306 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David?
L500305 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ OK.
L500304 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
L500296 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And now you tell me.
L500295 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I don't want to. It's different.
L500294 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
L500293 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I don't thinkI can.
L500292 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I thought we all were.
L500291 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Who's going to do it?
L500226 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Is that all?
L500225 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Unfeasible.
L500224 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L500223 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No, Alex. It's, it's --
L500211 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
L500210 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
L500209 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
L500208 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
L500207 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
L500206 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No.
L500205 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't look?
L500204 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Don't.
L500203 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm just looking.
L500202 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What are you doing?
L500201 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What? What's wrong?
L500200 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Alex.
L500199 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
L500198 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Did what?
L500197 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I wonder how he did it?
L500193 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ All right. No problem.
L500192 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes.
L500191 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Now?
L500190 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes.
L500189 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You want me to kick it open?
L500188 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Open it.
L500187 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ So?
L500186 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
L500185 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
L500184 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
L500183 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
L500182 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
L500181 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What sort of car?
L500180 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ So what's wrong with that?
L500179 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's got a car?
L500178 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ His car's still there.
L500177 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hugo.
L500176 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ David?
L500175 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Maybe he didn't like us.
L500174 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ So I gathered.
L500173 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David hasn't seen him either.
L500167 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No. Any idea which channel he's on?
L500166 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Have you seen Hugo?
L500158 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No, Alex, we don't really love you.
L500157 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You see, they don't really know me.
L500156 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ You're right.
L500155 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I think you're lying.
L500154 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yeah.
L500153 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Know and love?
L500152 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
L500151 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ The man we know and love.
L500150 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ -- which is a hack.
L500149 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ -- which is --
L500148 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What I am.
L500147 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ -- instead of what he is --
L500146 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It was you, Juliet, it was you --
L500145 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
L500142 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Not usually this drunk.
L500141 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm not usually drunk.
L500120 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
L500119 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Alex.
L500118 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Aroused and inflamed.
L500117 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
L500116 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ So we'll meet him, then?
L500108 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
L500107 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Who was it?
L500101 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
L500100 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
L500060 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
L500059 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
L500058 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, she had problems --
L500057 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ She hated you --
L500056 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
L500055 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ For the flat.
L500054 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
L500053 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
L500052 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
L500051 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
L500050 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I thought you stopped going.
L500044 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Just serve.
L500043 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Did you know --
L500030 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
L500029 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
L500024 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
L500023 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
L500018 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
L500017 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
L499990 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Really?
L499989 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes.
L499988 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Cameron?
L499987 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Cameron.
L500160 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ Yeah.
L500159 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Can you afford this place?
L500137 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
L500136 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ You mean I can have the room?
L500135 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's OK. There's no problem.
L500131 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
L500130 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ You were going to say something.
L500129 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L500128 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ What?
L500127 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ So, uh...
L500123 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
L500122 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ I see.
L500121 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Interesting.
L500626 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ That wasn't a question.
L500625 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes.
L500624 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You're sure of that.
L500623 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, I've never seen them.
L500524 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, that's right, that's it.
L500523 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Is this where no one stays?
L500522 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Someone lost the key.
L500521 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
L500520 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
L500519 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
L500518 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
L500517 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
L500516 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I see.
L500513 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
L500512 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, absolutely.
L500511 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
L500510 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, three. Who said there were four?
L500509 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
L500508 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Who said there were four?
L500507 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Two?
L500506 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There are only two other people in the flat.
L500505 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
L500504 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Of course.
L500503 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
L500502 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, nothing, sorry.
L500501 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
L500500 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
L500499 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ did you hear anything before he cries?
L500498 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
L500497 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Can we come in?
L500496 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Of course.
L500495 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Downstairs.
L500494 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Burglary?
L500493 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ It's about the burglary.
L500492 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What about?
L500491 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
L500705 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
L500704 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It wasn't like that.
L500703 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
L500701 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
L500700 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What?
L500699 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
L500698 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Eh, I don't know.
L500691 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ And you need your sleep.
L500690 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes.
L500673 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You and me?
L500672 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ So let's go.
L500588 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It was on the television.
L500587 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ We already know. All about it.
L500576 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I should hope so.
L500575 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L500562 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ With a face like this?
L500561 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I thought you'd gone to work.
L500546 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ If I think you're lying --
L500545 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No one.
L500544 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Who have you talked to?
L500543 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No one. I promise.
L500542 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
L500541 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No.
L500540 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
L500539 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What?
L500538 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Expecting anyone?
L500402 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
L500401 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ That's what it cost, David.
L500400 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You paid two hundred pounds for this?
L500399 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Two hundred pounds.
L500398 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Two hundred pounds?
L500397 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Two hundred.
L500374 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That was stressful. I found that stressful.
L500373 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
L500372 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L500371 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
L500332 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes. They're my friends.
L500331 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you know many of these people?
L500320 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500319 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Would you like to talk about it?
L500318 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
L500317 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Are you all right?
L500213 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
L500212 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I've never seen a dead body before.
L500196 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes.
L500195 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Is this what they always look like?
L500133 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
L500132 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Just get on with it, Alex.
L500028 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Did you ever kill a man?
L500027 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
L500022 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
L500021 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
L500016 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you smoke?
L500015 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Why do you want a room here?
L500265 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
L500264 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
L500263 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ You get the job done.
L500262 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm boring?
L500261 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ And that's why I think you fit in here.
L500260 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L500259 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
L500258 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm not sure --
L500257 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ But they sneer, don't they?
L500256 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Eh --
L500255 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
L500254 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Not any real sneering as such, no.
L500253 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ -- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
L500252 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Exactly what I was --
L500251 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
L500250 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
L500249 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ In this firm.
L500248 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Right here?
L500247 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ Here.
L500246 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sorry?
L500245 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ What do we do here, David?
L500244 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That's what I thought.
L500243 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Oh, him. Well, he died.
L500242 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
L500241 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Here?.
L500240 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That one, last week.
L500239 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What guy that died?
L500238 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That guy, the one that died.
L500237 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What guy?
L500236 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What happened to that guy?
L500235 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Hello.
L500099 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
L500098 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ And that's not the same thing?
L500097 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ I write about it?
L500096 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ You know about it?
L500095 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ The human condition.
L500094 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ A certain weakness.
L500093 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ For what?
L500092 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No. But he needs treatment.
L500091 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ And he's a patient of yours?
L500090 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I'm a doctor.
L500089 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ Working nights?
L500088 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
L500087 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ Shall I answer it?
L500086 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It's an improvement.
L500085 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ A little bit. Is that good or bad?
L500084 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Did he sound upset?
L500083 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ It was some guy called Brian.
L500081 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ All right.
L500080 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No.
L500079 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
L500078 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ The telephone? It continues to ring.
L500077 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Do you think you could answer that?
L500076 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ It's a breeze.
L500075 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Writing seems easy.
L500074 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
L500073 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No.
L500072 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
L500071 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I see.
L500070 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ A priest who dies.
L500069 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What's it about?
