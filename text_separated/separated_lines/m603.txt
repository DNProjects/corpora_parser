L650058 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
L650057 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
L650055 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But why would they do that...?
L650054 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ With his hands!
L649960 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Two heartbeats.
L649959 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Two what...?
L649958 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ There are two.
L649957 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
L649956 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Are you alright...?  You look pale.
L649818 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
L649817 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
L649815 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ But you've not told Michael.
L649814 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I have seen him again.  Last night.
L649794 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
L649793 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
L649792 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Thank you for this honor, my dear.
L649661 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
L649660 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
L649651 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
L649650 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Then what is he...?
L649649 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
L650156 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
L650155 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Rowan...
L650152 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
L650151 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What are you talk---
L650150 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
L650141 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Every day  twice.
L650140 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
L650138 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
L650137 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Nothing was ever more false.
L650136 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
L650053 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
L650052 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ "Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
L650051 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What have the witches always asked of you...?
L650004 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
L650003 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Michael, Rowan should -
L650002 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't tell Rowan about this.
L649752 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
L649751 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan.
L649750 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
L649749 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
L649653 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
L649652 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A what...?
L649520 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Come.  There is a lot to read
L649519 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
L649517 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
L649516 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
L649511 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
L649510 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
L649509 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
L649508 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
L649507 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
L649952 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
L649951 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
L649787 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
L649786 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Then you wear it.
L649785 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ 'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
L649784 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I don't want it.
L649783 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
L649719 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
L649718 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
L649717 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
L649705 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Nothing worse than a common tool.
L649704 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
L649703 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
L649702 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He made that quite clear, yes.
L649701 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
L649480 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I want to see my mother.
L649479 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
L649802 +++$+++ u8875 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ GIFFORD +++$+++ Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
L649801 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
L649800 +++$+++ u8875 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ GIFFORD +++$+++ I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
L649799 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
L649497 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
L649496 +++$+++ u8875 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ GIFFORD +++$+++ In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
L649495 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
L649609 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
L649608 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
L649606 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
L649605 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You - are - a - murderer.
L649604 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ ...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
L649603 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
L649602 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
L649599 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ ENOUGH!!!
L649598 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
L649597 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Stop it!
L649596 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
L649595 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It wes a dream...!
L649594 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Lasher touched you and you loved it.
L649591 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ 'He'...?
L649590 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
L649589 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
L649588 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
L649587 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
L649586 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You're a monster.
L649585 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ She didn't feel them
L649584 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
L649573 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
L649572 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Better than most, I suppose.
L649571 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
L649570 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ The lamplight.  That's all.
L649569 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ What is it...?
L649546 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ And this - if you decide to take the rest.
L649545 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Eighty million doll --- ?
L649544 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
L649543 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I don't want the -
L649526 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ There are things I have to know!
L649525 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ I'm tired.  I need to rest.
L649524 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
L649523 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
L649522 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
L649486 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
L649485 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
L649484 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.

L649453 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
L649452 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
L649451 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
L649450 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
L649449 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -

L650103 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
L650102 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
L650101 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I do not understand...

Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
L650066 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
L650065 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
L650064 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
L650063 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I know that you're evil.

L649979 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
L649978 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If that were true, I would not be here.
L649977 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Go away!  I don't want you here.
L649976 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ There is no one here but the dead.
L649975 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I bring her flowers too.
L649974 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
L649940 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?

L649938 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ 
L649937 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
L649936 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
L649935 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If you knew how I yearn for that...
L649934 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ To love, you must be able to feel.
L649933 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ It is from love.
L649932 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Made it...?

L649926 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
L649833 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ Always loved you..

L649654 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
L649643 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
L649642 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!

L649637 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
L649636 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.

L649631 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
L649630 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You know...?
L649465 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.

L649418 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ We're quite a pair, you and I.
L649417 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
L649416 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ 
L649415 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
L649414 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ God knows, I'm intriguing.
L649413 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
L649412 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
L649411 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Seems more like a year than a month.
L649407 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
L649406 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Stop it.
L649405 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
L649404 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm serious.  You don't -
L649403 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
L649402 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
L649401 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
L649400 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ All I meant was -
L649399 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
L649397 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Captain's orders.
L649396 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Doctor's orders- - -?
L649395 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
L649394 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why don't you let at do that...?
L649392 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
L649391 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
L649390 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
L649389 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
L649386 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
L649385 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
L649384 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He fools around with his patients too.
L649383 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
L649380 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
L649379 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Too much... too fast...?
L649378 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
L649377 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Really...?  Your family there...?
L649376 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I was born, in New Orleans, too-
L649374 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You still feel that crazy...?
L649373 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
L649372 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ And whose houses do you design...?
L649371 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
L649367 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
L649366 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It's unbelievable that you can do that.
L649365 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
L649364 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
L649363 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
L649362 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What else did you see- Michael...?
L649361 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
L649360 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ you're very --- different.
L649359 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Yessssss...
L649358 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
L649357 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ HARDER!
L649356 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan...
L649355 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Harder...
L649348 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
L649347 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
L649346 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
L649345 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The one time I want it to work...
L649344 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Just one.  The bar's closed.
L649343 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
L649342 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What do you see...?
L649339 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
L649338 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
L649336 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
L649335 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My jury's still out on that,
L649334 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm glad you're around to say it.
L649333 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
L649332 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ 'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
L649331 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
L649330 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
L649329 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They like you ------- kids.
L650085 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just don't fall off any ladders.

L649672 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
L649671 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
L649315 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Go away, GODDAMNIT!
L649314 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You can't just -

L649274 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I just - hate it when they're - finished.
L649273 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
L650087 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
L650086 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
L649910 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Is that what you were doing...?
L649909 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Is that a crack about our singing...?
L649908 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I thought it was 'whistle while you work.

L649737 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Papers...?
L649736 +++$+++ u8882 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ We'd better get to work on the papers.
