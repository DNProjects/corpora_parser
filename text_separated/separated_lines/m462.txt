L422762 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Lovely to meet you.
L422728 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Oh God.
L422727 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm a vegetarian.
L422726 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ What do you think of the guinea fowl?
L422717 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
L422716 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
L422676 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
L422675 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hi.
L422765 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Night, night, Honey.
L422764 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No!
L422761 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
L422760 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Now you're lying.
L422759 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
L422758 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm delighted.
L422757 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ That was such a great evening.
L422749 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well... a shot at it.
L422748 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
L422747 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Wait a minute.  What about me?
L423173 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
L423172 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
L423171 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And then I... right.
L423170 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ 'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
L423169 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
L423168 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
L423167 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
L423166 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm not listening.
L423165 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ God, that's an enormous arse.
L423164 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Oh, stop showing off.
L423163 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
L423162 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
L422714 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
L422713 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Fifteen million dollars.
L422712 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
L422711 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Films mainly.
L422710 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
L422709 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, they can be.
L422708 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
L422707 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm an actress.
L422706 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
L423310 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
L423309 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
L423303 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ And what would you say...
L423302 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
L423226 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
L423225 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
L423224 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
L423223 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
L423222 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ The truth is...
L423221 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
L423220 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
L423218 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
L423217 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Sorry about that.
L423204 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
L423203 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
L423202 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
L423201 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You were saying...
L423198 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What's the thing?
L423197 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
L423196 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
L423195 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
L423194 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Thank you.  Shall I...
L423193 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I thought I'd give it to you.
L423192 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
L423191 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
L423190 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well... how have you been?
L423189 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
L423188 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You disappeared.
L423187 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hello.
L423186 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hi.
L423155 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
L423154 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Okay.
L423153 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ But... wait... there are things to say.
L423152 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
L423151 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
L423149 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
L423148 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I only found out you were here yesterday.
L423147 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ This is certainly... ah...
L423099 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
L423098 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
L423097 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Excuse me?
L423096 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
L423095 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
L423092 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
L423091 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
L423088 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
L423087 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
L423086 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
L423085 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's spectacularly unfair.
L423084 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
L423083 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
L423082 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
L423081 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You do?
L423080 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
L423077 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
L423076 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's not true.
L423075 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
L423074 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't know what happened.
L423073 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ How do you think I'm doing?
L423072 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ How are you doing?
L423064 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Jesus.
L423063 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Undressed like this, yes.
L423062 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
L423060 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Don't ask.
L423059 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What?
L423056 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Damn, I forgot the jam.
L423055 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Stay forever.
L423054 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Can I stay a bit longer?
L423051 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh.
L423050 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
L423049 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
L423048 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Who was Gilda?
L423047 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
L423045 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
L423044 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
L423043 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
L423042 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
L423041 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well...
L423040 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
L423039 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
L423038 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You and every person in this country.
L423037 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
L423035 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What?
L423034 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Wow.
L423033 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
L423032 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay.
L423031 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh please sod off.
L423014 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Right.
L423013 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
L423012 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
L423011 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Both.
L423010 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
L423009 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
L423008 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
L423007 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
L423006 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
L423005 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
L423004 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You have a stunt bottom?
L423003 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
L423002 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
L423001 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
L423000 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Big feet -- large shoes.
L422999 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No.  What's that?
L422998 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You know what they say about men with big feet?
L422997 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.  Always have had.
L422996 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You've got big feet.
L422991 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
L422990 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ With a goat playing a violin.
L422989 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
L422988 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You like Chagall?
L422986 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ And I think the book is the poorer for it.
L422985 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
L422984 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
L422983 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You think I should do Henry James instead?
L422982 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
L422981 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What do you think?
L422980 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
L422979 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, get a message through to him too.
L422978 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yup.
L422977 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ My son's name is Johnny?
L422976 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ 'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
L422975 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
L422974 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Cartwright.
L422973 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
L422972 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Eleven.
L422971 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ 'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
L422970 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ 'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
L422969 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ 'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
L422968 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ 'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
L422967 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well done you.
L422966 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
L422965 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hand it over.  Basic plot?
L422964 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
L422963 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Would you like me to take you through your lines?
L422962 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
L422961 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
L422960 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
L422959 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh no no -- no.
L422958 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I have thought about you.
L422957 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
L422956 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
L422955 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
L422954 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
L422948 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ A bath would be great.
L422947 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
L422946 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
L422945 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
L422944 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ This is the place.
L422943 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
L422941 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Come in.
L422940 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hi.  Can I come in?
L422887 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I think goodbye is traditional.
L422886 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
L422885 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ -- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
L422860 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Your boyfriend?
L422859 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
L422858 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Why?
L422857 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You've got to go.
L422856 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
L422852 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
L422851 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
L422850 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
L422849 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I don't know either.
L422848 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't know, I'm afraid.
L422847 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
L422846 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, you were brilliant
L422845 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
L422837 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
L422836 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L422820 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Uh-oh.  That's not good.
L422819 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ She saw through me.
L422818 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Why?
L422817 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ She left me.
L422816 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ So who left who?
L422800 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Step aside.
L422799 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
L422797 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Exactly.  Here we go again.
L422796 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
L422795 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
L422794 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
L422793 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L422792 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes, you did.
L422791 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Nothing.
L422790 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What did you say?
L422789 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Whoopsidaisies.
L422787 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ahm...
L422786 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You abide by rules like that?
L422785 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
L422784 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Let's go in.
L422783 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
L422781 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I was.
L422780 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I thought you were leaving.
L422779 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Busy tomorrow?
L422778 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's fine.
L422777 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Too complicated.
L422775 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
L422774 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
L422773 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
L422772 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Why is she in a wheelchair?
L422771 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
L422770 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Floppy, huh?
L422751 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
L422750 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
L422665 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Okay.
L422664 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay.
L422663 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
L422662 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ If that's all right.
L422661 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
L422660 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
L422659 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
L422658 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay -- fine.
L422657 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
L422656 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
L422620 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
L422619 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
L422618 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes.
L422617 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Are you busy tonight?
L422611 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And what happens next in the dream?
L422610 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
L422606 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Absolutely fine about it.
L422605 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
L422604 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
L422603 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Obviously.  Very difficult.
L422602 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
L422601 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
L422595 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
L422594 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
L422592 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I brought these, but clearly...
L422591 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hello.
L422590 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hi.
L422568 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
L422567 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
L422566 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
L422565 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh -- Okay.
L422564 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
L422563 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
L422562 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
L422561 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hi.
L422560 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
L422507 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Bye.
L422506 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
L422505 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Probably best not tell anyone about this.
L422499 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
L422498 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
L422497 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Thanks.  Well...
L422496 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Here we go.
L422495 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh right.
L422494 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I forgot my bag.
L422493 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh hi.  Forget something?
L422489 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
L422488 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Thank you.
L422486 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
L422485 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
L422484 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Do you always say 'no' to everything?
L422483 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No.
L422482 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
L422481 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Really, no.
L422480 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
L422479 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Orange juice -- probably not.
L422478 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No.
L422477 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Coffee?
L422476 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No thanks.
L422475 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
L422471 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
L422470 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
L422469 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
L422468 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
L422467 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
L422465 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Here, let me help.
L422464 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh Jesus.
L422435 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
L422434 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
L422433 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Sorry about that...
L422418 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Thanks.  I'll think about it.
L422417 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
L422416 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.  This one though is... very good.
L422415 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Really?
L422414 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
L422413 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Fine.
L422412 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
L422883 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
L422882 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I haven't decided.
L422881 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
L422880 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Nice surprise.
L422879 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
L422875 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
L422874 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
L422862 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Who is it?
L422861 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes...
L422444 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Tempting but... no, thank you.
L422443 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
L422442 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
L422441 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ What does it say?
L422440 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ Rufus.
L422439 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What's your name?
L422438 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ Can I have your autograph?
L422437 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes.
L422436 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ Excuse me.
L423214 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
L423213 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
L423212 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
L423211 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
L423210 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Is that right?
L423209 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
L423258 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
L423257 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
L423256 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L422907 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And this is William.
L422906 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ That's right.
L422670 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Christ, what is going on in there?
L422669 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ He wouldn't say.
L422668 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Does the girl have a name?
L422667 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Miracles do happen.
L422666 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's bringing a girl?
L423117 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
L423116 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ No!
L423115 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ ... get fired.
L423114 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
L422743 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
L422742 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ No.  Not true...
L422724 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
L422723 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Yup.
L422722 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ The movie star?
L422721 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Yes.
L422720 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Anna Scott?
L422719 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
L423241 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes, I think that one may be.
L423240 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ This painting isn't the original, is it?
L423232 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Tony -- what do you think?
L423231 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
L422939 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
L422938 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Do you want to stay?
L422937 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
L422936 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
L422935 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ I never fancied you much actually...
L422934 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ In a depressingly asexual way.
L422933 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Still loves you though.
L422678 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Right. 
L422677 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bella -- this is Anna.
L422674 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Don't even ask.
L422673 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ He's cooking guinea fowl?
L422672 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
L423266 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Is Miss Scott staying here?
L423265 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Bloody hell, this is fun.
L423247 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
L423246 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
L423245 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What?
L423244 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ That's nice.
L423243 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- sort of...
L423242 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ But she said she wanted to go out with you?
L422733 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
L422732 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bernie.
L423252 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Where's Bella?
L423251 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ And we intend to use them!
L423250 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
L422731 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
L422730 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Shame!
L422729 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
L422697 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
L422696 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Bernie -- this is Anna.
L422695 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
L422694 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hello, Bernie.
L422651 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
L422650 +++$+++ u6899 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Di Caprio.
L422649 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Da Vinci?
L422648 +++$+++ u6899 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Working with Leonardo.
L422647 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
L422646 +++$+++ u6899 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ No -- it's my 22nd.
L422645 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Is this your first film?
L423315 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ It was good.
L423314 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ What happened?
L423239 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ You daft prick!
L423238 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ William has just turned down Anna Scott.
L423237 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I was called and I came.  What's up?
L423127 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well, yes.  Groovy.
L423126 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Yes.  What do you think?
L423125 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Me?
L423124 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ By the way -- it's you.
L423230 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
L423229 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What do you think?  Good move?
L423108 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
L423107 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, thanks, that's great.
L423106 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
L423105 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Blimey.  What's that?
L423104 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
L422687 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
L422686 +++$+++ u6900 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
L422878 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ahm... Bernie.
L422877 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What's your name?
L422876 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ah -- no.  It's fine.
L422873 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.
L422872 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
L422871 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
L422870 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
L422869 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
L422868 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Still, not sparkling.
L422867 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'll see what I can do.
L422866 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
L422865 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
L422864 +++$+++ u6902 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
L422863 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ahm... room service.
L423158 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ This is Henry James film?
L423157 +++$+++ u6903 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Are you a fan of Henry James?
L422654 +++$+++ u6903 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Have you got a moment?
L422653 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes?
L422652 +++$+++ u6903 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Mr. Thacker?
L422627 +++$+++ u6903 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
L422626 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ The others?
L422625 +++$+++ u6903 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
L422582 +++$+++ u6903 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
L422581 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ 'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
L422578 +++$+++ u6903 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
L422577 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I agree.
L422635 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
L422634 +++$+++ u6904 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MALE LEAD +++$+++ Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
L422633 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Any bit in particular?
L422632 +++$+++ u6904 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MALE LEAD +++$+++ I did.
L422631 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
L422630 +++$+++ u6904 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MALE LEAD +++$+++ Well, fire away.
L422629 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ah... yes, enormously.
L422628 +++$+++ u6904 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MALE LEAD +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
L423208 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
L423207 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
L423206 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
L423205 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
L423185 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
L423184 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
L423183 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
L423182 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
L422524 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Can I help you?
L422523 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Martin -- your customer.
L422463 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
L422462 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right -- want another one?
L422461 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Not classic, no.
L422460 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
L422459 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I suppose so.
L422458 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ So it could have been neither of them?
L422457 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ No, well... he was quite a long way away.
L422456 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
L422455 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ That's right -- Topol.
L422454 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Topol.
L422453 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
L422451 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Who?  Someone famous?
L422450 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
L422449 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Cappuccino as ordered.
L422409 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
L422408 +++$+++ u6905 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
L422407 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
L423236 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
L423235 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
L423139 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So not over her, in fact.
L423138 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh God no.
L423137 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
L423136 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, don't think I do.
L423135 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
L423134 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I believe I have.
L423133 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So -- you've laid the ghost.
L423131 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
L423130 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
L423129 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
L423128 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Any more announcements?
L423122 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Is it someone we know?
L423121 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
L422932 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
L422931 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's not fair.
L422930 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
L422928 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ She's perfect, perfect.
L422927 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well?
L422900 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Really?
L422899 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
L422898 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Buggered?
L422897 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
L422896 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
L422895 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No -- did you?
L422894 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
L422746 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I think you do, yes.
L422745 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ So I get the brownie?
L422705 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You see -- it means 'yes.'
L422704 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Definitely no comment.
L422703 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Do you ever masturbate?
L422702 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, it doesn't.
L422701 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ 'No comment' means 'yes.'
L422700 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
L422699 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You haven't slept with her, have you?
L422681 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
L422680 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Max.  This is Anna.
L423272 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
L423271 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L423270 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
L423269 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L423268 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ How about Miss Flintstone?
L423267 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L422553 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
L422552 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
L422551 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
L422550 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
L422549 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
L422548 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ May I help you, sir?
L422547 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hello.
L423146 +++$+++ u6908 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SECURITY +++$+++ ... can't let you through.
L423145 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
L423144 +++$+++ u6908 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SECURITY +++$+++ I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
L423143 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, no.  She doesn't.
L423142 +++$+++ u6908 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SECURITY +++$+++ Does she know you're coming?
L423141 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
L423140 +++$+++ u6908 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SECURITY +++$+++ Can I help you?
L423181 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
L423180 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right -- let's talk about rent...
L423179 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
L423178 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm going to throw out these old videos.
L423177 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ What's going on?
L423103 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.
L423102 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
L423101 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Was it you?
L423094 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
L423093 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
L423079 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
L423078 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
L423069 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Just take my work for it.
L423068 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Why not?
L423067 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I wouldn't go outside.
L423030 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
L423029 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'll talk to you in the morning.
L423028 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ No -- you're right.
L423027 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Spike!
L423026 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
L423025 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
L423024 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
L423023 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L423022 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ And you get on very well.
L423021 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L423020 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ And she's in your house.
L423019 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Maybe.
L423018 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
L423017 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Spike.
L423016 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
L423015 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh my God...  Hello.
L422995 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
L422994 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
L422891 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
L422890 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
L422889 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, okay.  There's this girl...
L422815 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Sort of.
L422814 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ You're welcome.  Did you find them?
L422813 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
L422812 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
L422811 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
L422810 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
L422809 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ No, 'fraid not.
L422808 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
L422557 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
L422556 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
L422555 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What?
L422554 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Try 'Flintstone.'
L422546 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
L422545 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Which was?
L422544 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
L422543 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What did she say?
L422541 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L422540 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  No one else?
L422539 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
L422538 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
L422537 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ You want me to write down all your messages?
L422536 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Two?  That's it?
L422535 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
L422534 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ So -- any messages?
L422533 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
L422532 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
L422531 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ There's something wrong with the goggles though...
L422530 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
L422529 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
L422528 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
L422527 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
L422526 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hi...
L422525 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Hey.
L422517 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
L422516 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
L422510 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
L422509 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
L422508 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ There's something wrong with this yogurt.
L422404 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Good luck.
L422403 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
L422402 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
L422401 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
L422400 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
L422399 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Cool, huh?
L422397 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Point taken.
L422396 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
L422395 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
L422394 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What are the choices?
L422393 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
L422392 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
L422391 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
L422623 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
L422622 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Fabulous.
L422621 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ How was she?
L422587 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ Oh sure.  Of course.
L422586 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
L422585 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
L422584 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
L422573 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh.  Right.
L422572 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ Yes.
L422571 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Are you sure you...?
L422570 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ Three.
L422569 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Which floor?
L422432 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
L422431 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
L422430 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
L422429 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ I haven't got a book down my trousers.
L422428 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ The one down your trousers.
L422427 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ What book?
L422426 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
L422425 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ So?
L422424 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
L422423 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ What?
L422422 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bad news.
L422421 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ Yes.
L422420 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Excuse me.
