L611591 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
L611590 +++$+++ u3301 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CLEAR MOON +++$+++ They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
L611589 +++$+++ u3301 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CLEAR MOON +++$+++ Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
L611588 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Mr. Clear Moon.
L611412 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
L611411 +++$+++ u3301 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CLEAR MOON +++$+++ Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
L611410 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I see.
L611409 +++$+++ u3301 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CLEAR MOON +++$+++ Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
L611408 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I thought we were staying on the reservation.
L611435 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
L611434 +++$+++ u3304 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.

L611429 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ A murder. On the reservation.
L611428 +++$+++ u3304 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ FBI? What you investigatin'?
L611427 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.

L611423 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
L611527 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ -- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
L611526 +++$+++ u3305 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ LOOKS TWICE +++$+++ You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
L611525 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
L611524 +++$+++ u3305 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ LOOKS TWICE +++$+++ What's this about?
L611518 +++$+++ u3305 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ LOOKS TWICE +++$+++ That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
L611517 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ James Looks Twice?
L611516 +++$+++ u3305 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ LOOKS TWICE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L611329 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
L611328 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
L611327 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
L611326 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
L611323 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Sioux Indian, right?
L611322 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
L611313 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Oh, yeah -- right.
L611312 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.

L611392 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ -- did you understand me when I said that --
L611391 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
L611388 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
L611387 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
L611383 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Good. Thank you.
L611382 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ -- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
L611379 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Tell him, Ray.
L611378 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ What journey?
L611377 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
L611376 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
L611375 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
L611369 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
L611368 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
L611367 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
L611366 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
L611365 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Who are you?
L611364 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ It ain't Geronimo.
L611363 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
L611360 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
L611359 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
L612009 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Let the press through.
L612008 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Ray...
L612004 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No way, Cooch.
L612003 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Come on, Ray. Come forward.
L611967 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
L611966 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
L611965 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
L611964 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
L611963 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
L611961 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
L611960 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ -- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
L611959 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
L611958 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
L611848 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Cuz I want New York.
L611847 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why?
L611846 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
L611825 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ -- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
L611824 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
L611823 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
L611822 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
L611821 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Jesus, you alright?
L611746 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
L611745 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
L611741 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yes.
L611740 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Tread matches. It's the car.
L611739 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
L611738 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
L611737 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
L611736 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ She's that subtle?
L611735 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
L611734 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
L611733 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
L611732 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Bastards...
L611730 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ And get rid of the dog.
L611729 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Thanks, Cooch.
L611728 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I'll sleep around a little.
L611726 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
L611725 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Alright. Alright...
L611724 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
L611723 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
L611722 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
L611721 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
L611720 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
L611719 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
L611718 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
L611717 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ When did we get that?
L611716 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
L611706 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
L611705 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
L611644 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ A long way from home. You be careful out there.
L611643 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
L611641 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
L611640 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
L611639 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Her oil pan is shot.
L611638 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
L611637 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
L611636 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
L611631 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I gave it back to her.
L611630 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Let's see it.
L611629 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
L611628 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
L611627 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ What'd she say?
L611509 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Alright. Alright.
L611508 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
L611507 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
L611506 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
L611505 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
L611504 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ That's right.
L611503 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
L611501 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
L611500 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Who is he?
L611498 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cooch. You're my hero.
L611497 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Meet me at base. Over.
L611496 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I've got the doer. I know who he is.
L611495 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Go ahead.
L611494 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I got one up on ya.
L611493 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How'd you know?
L611492 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Maisy Blue Legs place?
L611445 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Good.
L611444 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Couldn't sleep.
L611443 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I already did.
L611442 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
L611441 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
L611405 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
L611404 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No. That's Ray here. Ray...
L611398 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Beats the hell outta me.
L611397 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
L611390 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
L611389 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
L611381 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
L611380 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
L611372 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- a fucking cop.
L611371 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Who the fuck is he?
L611370 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I did.
L611362 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Check him out, Ray.
L611361 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This is a restricted area.
L611357 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Ray.
L611356 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
L611355 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
L611354 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Six rounds. 357.
L611345 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?

L611343 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
L611341 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
L611340 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Were you in Nam?
L611339 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
L611338 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Jesus...
L611337 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
L611334 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Seven.
L611333 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
L611321 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
L611320 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
L612020 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
L612019 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You take care.
L612017 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You didn't have another vision...
L612016 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
L612013 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Some Indian time?
L612012 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.

L611988 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
L611984 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
L611983 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's gone.
L611980 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Bullshit, let's get outta here,
L611979 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
L611978 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
L611977 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...

L611948 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
L611947 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
L611940 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
L611939 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
L611938 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
L611937 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
L611936 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
L611935 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This Clear Moon's house?
L611932 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
L611931 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ So they took care of Leo.
L611930 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
L611929 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
L611928 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
L611927 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ What?
L611926 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ 1868...
L611925 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
L611924 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Jesus. Oil?
L611923 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
L611922 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's that?
L611921 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Stop.
L611920 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What the hell do you want me to do?!
L611919 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
L611918 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah. Fitful dreams.
L611917 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
L611916 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
L611915 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I'm a full-blood Oglala.
L611914 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sorry.
L611913 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
L611912 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Nothin'. Forget it.
L611911 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L611910 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
L611909 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Well, it was just a dream, I --
L611908 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
L611907 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
L611906 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Where was this?
L611905 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
L611904 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
L611903 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Do they come in dreams, these visions?
L611901 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
L611900 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
L611899 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
L611898 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You got Jimmy. Let her go.
L611897 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
L611896 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
L611895 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Crow Horse, listen --
L611894 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
L611765 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
L611764 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
L611763 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
L611762 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
L611760 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
L611759 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
L611758 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Still after Jimmy?
L611757 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
L611756 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
L611755 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L611754 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Not no more.
L611753 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cuz you're a cop.
L611752 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Cuz I'm a skin?
L611751 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
L611750 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
L611749 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
L611748 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
L611700 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Likewise.
L611699 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Take care of yourself, Walter.
L611691 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
L611690 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
L611689 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
L611688 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's not real.
L611687 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ What you call myths, we call our history.
L611686 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
L611685 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ What'd you expect to hear?
L611684 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
L611683 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Ray --
L611682 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
L611681 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
L611680 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't tell me: heavy duty.
L611679 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Red Deer Table, Ray.
L611676 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ A what?
L611675 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
L611670 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
L611669 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
L611668 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
L611667 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
L611659 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
L611658 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's not solid.
L611657 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
L611656 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't see the connection.
L611655 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
L611654 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
L611653 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
L611650 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She's your sister?
L611649 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
L611647 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
L611646 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
L611578 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
L611577 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
L611576 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He also said "listen to the water."
L611575 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
L611574 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
L611573 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So what?
L611572 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He saw an owl.
L611571 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And...
L611570 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
L611568 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Because he was talking to me.
L611567 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Why should I tell you.
L611566 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What was he saying?
L611564 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
L611563 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He said he doesn't know.
L611562 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What did he say?
L611556 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
L611555 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's he smoke in that?
L611552 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
L611551 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He knows me?
L611550 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
L611548 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
L611547 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What did he say?
L611545 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
L611544 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why does he wanna see me?
L611543 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Medicine. As in medicine man?
L611542 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
L611541 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Let's go.
L611540 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
L611539 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
L611538 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
L611537 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
L611478 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
L611477 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
L611476 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
L611475 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ His spiritual mother...
L611474 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
L611473 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
L611472 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
L611471 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
L611470 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
L611469 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You've got no jurisdiction.
L611468 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
L611467 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
L611466 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
L611465 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
L611464 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ -- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
L611463 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Bullshit.
L611462 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
L611459 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ -- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
L611458 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
L611457 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You're steppin' on sign.
L611456 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?!
L611455 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Watch out!
L611454 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What are you --
L611385 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ After we've completed our investigation.
L611384 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
L611813 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Great.
L611812 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
L611811 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L611810 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
L611809 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Your relatives must've taught you something.
L611803 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
L611802 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I desecrated it?
L611801 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ -- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
L611800 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
L611623 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Move it, Magdelana.
L611622 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
L611621 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
L611620 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L611618 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
L611617 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
L611616 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
L611615 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
L611614 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
L611613 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Who did?
L611612 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ -- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
L611611 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
L611610 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
L611609 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
L611608 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
L611607 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This Jimmy's?
L611604 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right. Turn around.
L611603 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're the Indian FBI.
L611993 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
L611992 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
L611946 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm on my way back in. Over.

L611788 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
L611787 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Good.
L611786 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
L611785 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I read, Cooch.

L611781 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
L611600 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
L611599 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.

L611330 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
L611325 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ -- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
L611324 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
L611311 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No. No, no. Thank you.

L611884 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
L611883 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
L611882 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
L611881 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.

L611879 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
L611878 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
L611877 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How the hell do you know?

L611872 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen.

L611868 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
L611867 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Get up out of the chair, Richard.
L611866 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ What the fuck you talkin' about?
L611865 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
L611862 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
