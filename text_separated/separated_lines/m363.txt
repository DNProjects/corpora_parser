L230233 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
L230232 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
L230231 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I never left the garage without my Windex.
L230018 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Do not inhale.
L230017 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
L230016 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We must abandon.
L230013 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Ruptured steam pipe.
L230012 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you mean, we must abandon?
L230011 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ We must abandon.
L229951 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Very bad today.
L229950 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Crosstown.
L229949 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ You are going where?
L229948 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
L229908 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
L229907 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Big mess every time.
L229906 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What did you find?
L229905 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ I opened thousands of brains.
L229904 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Very big.
L229903 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
L229900 +++$+++ u5446 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Where you're going, mister?
L229899 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I used to drive a taxi.
L230058 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
L230057 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Alla puttanesca.
L230056 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Say it again.
L230053 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
L230052 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ This is a great young out-of-work actress.
L230051 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Elliot?
L230050 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
L230049 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Guys ready to order?
L230325 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ She was very evasive.
L230324 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Had to be him.
L230323 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
L230322 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L230321 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Paisley Porter.
L230320 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How do you Eknow.
L230319 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Keep going west. Last building before the river.
L230318 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
L230317 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ The American theater doesn't need people like that.
L230316 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Shoot him.
L230313 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ There are things that speak to us from the past.
L230312 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What?
L230311 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
L230310 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We were thinking of putting in a pool.
L230309 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
L230308 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He'll hate it.
L230307 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ It's your best play, Nicky.
L230306 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
L230303 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
L230302 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
L230301 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No, we're not.
L230300 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We're making too much of this.
L230297 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ That was a big mistake.
L230296 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
L230295 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Where is it?
L230294 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
L230293 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Then you should carry a gun.
L230292 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He carries a gun.
L230113 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ What about the haircut?
L230112 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't wait Efor me.
L230111 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Where are you going?
L230107 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't have the problems that artists have.
L230106 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
L230105 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Here we go.
L230104 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I'm not ready.
L230103 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Do not inhale.
L230102 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ You say we go?
L230101 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I say we go.
L230100 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I think we Nought to wait.
L230099 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Do we care?
L230098 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Is it safe?
L230078 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
L230077 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What was it like?
L230076 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
L230046 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
L230045 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
L230044 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That's awful.
L230043 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
L230042 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And he was there?
L230041 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
L230040 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What happened eighteen months ago?
L230039 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ That's what I said eighteen months ago.
L230038 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What's the fuss? I don't get it.
L230037 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
L230036 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's just a review.
L230035 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
L230034 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You mean because What's-His-Name.
L230033 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
L230032 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Tonight. What's tonight?
L230031 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
L230030 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
L230029 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ What do I exude?
L230028 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
L230027 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
L230026 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
L230024 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Do not inhale.
L230023 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We must abandon.
L230022 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Asbestos lining.
L230021 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Very dangerous.
L230010 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
L230009 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
L230008 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ But didn't we know it would happen?
L230007 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
L230006 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
L230005 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's over, finished and done with.
L230004 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Don't talk like that.
L230003 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ She wants a divorce.
L230002 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
L230001 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Ride with me. We need a haircut.
L230000 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Press a button and they give us money.
L229999 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
L229998 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Quietly effective.
L229997 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Shut up, Elliot.
L229996 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
L229995 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't want to hear about it.
L229994 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
L230520 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're not making sense. Make sense.
L230519 +++$+++ u5448 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ FIRST MAN +++$+++ Did you see the winning run score?
L230518 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Of course I saw it.
L230513 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes. What are you implying?
L230512 +++$+++ u5448 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ FIRST MAN +++$+++ What are we talking about?
L230511 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L230510 +++$+++ u5448 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ FIRST MAN +++$+++ I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
L230504 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Classic.
L230503 +++$+++ u5448 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ FIRST MAN +++$+++ Unbelievable.
L230502 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Great game.
L230368 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230367 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could be it.
L230366 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Does what feel comfortable?
L230365 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Does it feel comfortable?
L230364 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230363 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could be it.
L230362 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230361 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could be it.
L230200 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230199 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could Pbe it.
L230179 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Let's work on it.
L230178 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Let's work on it.
L230177 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230176 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could be it.
L229947 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ He will absolutely hate it.
L229946 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ They'll lose because they're my team.
L229945 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ It's your best play, Nicky.
L229944 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
L229943 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
L229942 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
L229941 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
L229940 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We don't even like each other, do we?
L229939 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Because we're completely mismatched.
L229938 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ In and out of bed.
L229937 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ We're able to surprise each other.
L229936 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This is how we've managed to last.
L229935 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
L229933 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ It can't be all that personal.
L229932 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
L229931 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
L229930 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The Red Sox
L229929 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ What?
L229928 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
L229927 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
L229926 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
L229925 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
L229924 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ About what?
L229923 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
L229922 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
L229921 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
L229920 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Can he get through it?
L229919 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
L229918 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Our Peter?
L229917 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
L229916 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I talked to her two days ago.
L229915 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ She died.
L229914 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ She's dying.
L229913 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ What about her?
L229912 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know about Adele.
L229911 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
L229910 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I hear Alan's sick.
L229909 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
L230572 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Daddy, wait.
L230571 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
L230569 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ There's nothing left for me to lie about.
L230568 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Will I believe you when you tell me something?
L230567 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Everything.
L230566 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What will we talk about?
L230564 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
L230563 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Except I won't have a father anymore.
L230562 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
L230227 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L230226 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
L230225 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I have a class. I'm late.
L230224 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
L230223 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
L230222 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Take it yourself. Take a date.
L230221 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
L230220 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
L230219 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Opening night?
L230218 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
L230217 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
L229991 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
L229990 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
L229989 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
L229988 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
L229986 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
L229985 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ She is kicking you out.
L229984 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
L229983 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
L229982 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
L229981 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
L229980 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
L229979 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
L229978 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
L229968 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
L229967 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
L229966 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
L229965 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Is it?
L229964 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That's completely crazy.
L229963 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
L229962 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why do you need a radio?
L229961 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
L229960 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
L229959 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
L229958 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Do you want to get some coffee?
L229957 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I go to college. I thought you knew.
L229956 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
L230596 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
L230595 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ See, Daddy.
L230592 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
L230591 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What else?
L230590 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
L230589 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ See, Daddy.
L230588 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ It's your best play, Nicky.
L230587 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
L230559 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yes.
L230558 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Am I really so deeply repugnant?
L230549 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
L230548 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
L230547 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
L230546 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ What's sexy?
L230545 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
L230544 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Mystery. Deception.
L230543 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What do we want?
L230542 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
L230541 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
L230540 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ This building is not secure.
L230539 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yes.
L230538 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ If you're wondering about the firearm.
L230535 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ A flat-out hit.
L230534 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ What else?
L230533 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Packs an emotional wallop.
L230532 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ What else?
L230531 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Brilliantly moving.
L230530 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ First you tell me.
L230529 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
L230528 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
L230527 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I'm willing to tell you my name.
L230526 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ It's only our first date.
L230525 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Why won't you tell me your name?
L230422 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
L230421 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I'm glad we're having this talk.
L230420 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
L230419 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
L230418 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
L230417 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ It violates so many trusts.
L230416 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I am really, deeply sorry.
L230415 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ She's my gynecologist.
L230414 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
L230413 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
L230412 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Alma Wetzel.
L230411 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Joanne Bourne.
L230410 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
L230409 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
L230408 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ There may be things you'd rather not know about.
L230407 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Be open with me. I'd like that.
L230406 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
L230405 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ That's very lovely actually.
L230404 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
L230403 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I'd forgotten that.
L230402 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
L230401 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
L230400 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And you've been extremely patient.
L230399 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ That's always been my problem.
L230398 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
L230397 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Who the hell cares?
L230396 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Opening night, Lillian.
L230392 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
L230391 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
L230390 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll have whatever she's having.
L230389 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
L230388 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How prominent?
L230387 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
L230386 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right. What's been going on?
L230385 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
L230384 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
L230383 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
L230382 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Two-all after six.
L230381 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Your father said you might be here.
L230500 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Life is real.
L230499 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Life is true.
L230493 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ This could be it!
L230492 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This could be it!
L230484 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ You're hurting my head.
L230483 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A thousand things.
L230482 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ What did it say?
L230481 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
L230474 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ One more out.
L230473 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Washed away.
L230472 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All the failures, all the fatalism.
L230452 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know if I can say that.
L230451 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ People are dependable.
L230446 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Life is good.
L230445 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Life is good.
L230425 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ They're always winning. Until they lose.
L230424 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Great game. Red Sox are winning.
L230370 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
L230369 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ What's it like to shoot somebody?
L230354 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
L230353 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
L230291 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Show him who we are.
L230290 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L230289 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So what are you going to do about it?
L230288 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
L230287 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
L230286 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
L230285 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
L230284 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
L230283 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
L230282 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I know, Pop.
L230281 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ `Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
L230278 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
L230277 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I lost it. I lose everything.
L230276 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
L230275 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I can't find it.
L230274 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where's your elastic brace?
L230273 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My back is killing me.
L230272 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Let's not start that again.
L230271 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Since when did that matter?
L230270 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
L230269 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
L230268 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
L230267 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
L230266 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ But the son is suppose to stop crying.
L230265 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
L230264 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
L230263 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
L230262 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
L230261 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
L230260 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They're only gonna lose.
L230259 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
L230258 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You know the answer to that.
L230257 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
L230256 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
L230255 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We must have been heroic.
L230254 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Get yourself something to eat.
L230253 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
L230252 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
L230251 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
L230250 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
L230249 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm on my way to get a haircut.
L230248 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ If it's you, what are you doing here?
L230247 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where are your glasses? Go get them.
L230246 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nicky comes on Sunday's.
L230245 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's me. Nicky.
L230244 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What do you want?
L230243 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Right here. At the door.
L230242 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Where the hell are you?
L230241 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Pop, will you let me in?
L230240 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Go way. I'll call a cop.
L230239 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm at the door.
L230238 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Who is it?
L230495 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This could be it!
L230494 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ This could be it!
L230480 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
L230479 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Don't worry. It's a test.
L230471 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Because faith is rewarded.
L230470 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Because life is good.
L230469 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Washed away.
L230468 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
L230466 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
L230465 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Because God loves a winner.
L230464 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
L230450 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Matthew.
L230449 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know.
L230444 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
L230443 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Life is good.
L230442 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Then say it.
L230441 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
L230440 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
L230435 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
L230434 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I want to believe.
L230433 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
L230432 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
L230431 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
L230428 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
L230427 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
L230426 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
L230380 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ It's a simple subject.
L230379 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's a complicated subject.
L230378 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
L230377 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
L230376 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
L230375 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
L230374 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You're a family man, Frankie?
L230372 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
L230371 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
L230360 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That's my cousin, Angelo.
L230359 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
L230358 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
L230357 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You're charming the boy.
L230356 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What am I doing?
L230355 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You see what you're doing, don't you?
L230348 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
L230347 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ That's a simple subject.
L230346 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Now that's a complicated subject.
L230345 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
L230344 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's the kid's lucky day.
L230343 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
L230342 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A grandmother. God bless you.
L230341 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Matthew's my grandson.
L230340 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How come you got the kid with you?
L230339 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
L230338 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
L230337 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
L230336 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
L230335 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
L230334 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L230333 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
L230332 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Everybody else does. Why not you?
L230331 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
L230594 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ You're out of bullets.
L230593 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
L230586 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What about my play?
L230585 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
L230584 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
L230583 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
L230582 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
L230581 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
L230580 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
L230579 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
L230578 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. They're not your team. They're my team.
L230577 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ They're my team.
L230576 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why do you care?
L230575 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
L230574 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why does it matter?
L230573 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Then they lost?
L230142 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
L230141 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
L230140 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
L230139 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Postpone. We have every right.
L230138 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
L230137 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ 'm not worried about this kid.
L230136 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
L230135 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ hat was this morning.
L230134 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
L230133 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
L230132 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
L230131 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
L230515 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're not making sense.
L230514 +++$+++ u5458 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SECOND MAN +++$+++ Game six is history,pal.
L230509 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Eleventh inning. What else?
L230508 +++$+++ u5458 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SECOND MAN +++$+++ Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
L230507 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Have to hurry back.
L230064 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
L230063 +++$+++ u5458 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SECOND MAN +++$+++ How come?
L230062 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I hate the Mets.
L230457 +++$+++ u5462 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
L230456 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
L230394 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
L230393 +++$+++ u5462 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Yessiree, Bob.
L230073 +++$+++ u5462 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
L230072 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why?
L230071 +++$+++ u5462 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
L230070 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L230175 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
L230174 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This could be it.
L230171 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
L230170 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And the Father replies?
L230162 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
L230161 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes.
L230160 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I kissed her while she was laughing.
L230159 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes.
L230158 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
L230157 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Mine was cobalt blue.
L230156 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Burnt sienna.
L230155 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
L230154 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What color?
L230153 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
L230152 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
L230151 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes, Peter.
L230150 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
L230149 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes.
L230148 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I have excellent long-term memory.
L230147 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes.
L230146 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I was educated by nuns.
L230145 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
L230144 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sidney.
L230143 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Sidney remains optimistic.
L230202 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
L230201 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
L230198 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ He goes to the theater armed.
L230197 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes.
L230196 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Our Steven not only disguises himself.
L230195 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What? Come on, Paisley.
L230194 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Never mind.
L230193 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes.
L230192 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
L230191 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
L230190 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
L230189 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
L230188 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
L230187 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
L230186 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ No one's waiting.
L230185 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Someone waiting for you?
L230184 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Home.
L230183 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where are you going now?
L230182 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ He's a very sweet man.
L230181 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know.
L230180 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Do you think he can do it?
L230129 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
L230128 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But you're his friend.
L230127 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
L230126 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He wears a disguise.
L230125 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Is what true?
L230124 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Is it true?
L230123 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ The fact is, I have to get going.
L230122 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
L230121 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
L230120 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Would you like to meet him?
L230119 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
L230118 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So do I. Over and over.
L230117 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ I hear good things about the new play.
L230116 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
L230115 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
L230114 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
L230097 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ One more time.
L230096 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Alla puttanesca.
L230095 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know what.
L230094 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ What?
L230093 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Say it again.
L230092 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ A little drastic maybe?
L230091 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
L230090 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Engaging.
L230089 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Endearing.
L230088 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
L230087 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And he has finer moments now and then.
L230086 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ A little.
L230085 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh. You know him.
L230084 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Not one of Steven's finer moments.
L230083 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So does Elliot.
L230082 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ I think I remember.
L230081 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ There was a review.
L230080 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
L230079 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You've worked with Elliot?
L230055 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
L230054 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What's good?
L230215 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ I'm going home to my machine.
L230214 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
L230213 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ I don't want you, Steven.
L230212 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
L230211 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
L230210 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
L230209 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
L230208 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
L230207 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
L230206 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ But you're here. So you must have come to me.
L230205 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ I haven't come to you.
L230204 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
