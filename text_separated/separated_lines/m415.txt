But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes.

And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?

They didn't want me.

L336241 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?

L335968 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
L335967 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ No.
L335966 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
L335965 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ I told you before, you wouldn't understand.

L335838 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
L335837 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ When?
L335836 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
L335826 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
L335825 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Thanks.
L335824 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.

L335800 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No, I said what did you think.
L335799 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You said it was!
L335798 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ And I don't think that was Tom.
L335797 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
L335796 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Try some other ways.

L335720 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.

L335718 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
L335717 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
L335716 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ How would I remember?
L335715 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
L335714 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Most of them.
L335713 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?

L335702 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
L335701 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?

Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.

L335696 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --

L335686 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!

L335622 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Mm.
L335621 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?

L335611 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
L335610 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You said that.

L336169 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
L336168 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Just send me a money order.
L336167 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.

L336162 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ All right, but I'm going to see that list.
L336161 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
L336160 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
L336159 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
L336158 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
L336157 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I can't follow you.

L336154 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
L336153 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ What?
L336152 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
L336151 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
L336150 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Someone's been doing all these things.
L336149 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
L336148 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
L336147 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ That who?
L336146 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
L336145 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You must be discouraged.
L336144 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
L336143 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Some mistake perhaps that --
L336142 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
L336141 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
L336140 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
L336139 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I don't understand.
L336138 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
L336137 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
L336136 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Yeah, two things Pete, that --
L336135 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
L336134 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L336133 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
L336132 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Well as a matter of --
L336131 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
L336130 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Well there's a couple --
L336129 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
L335931 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
L335930 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ How is it back there?
L335929 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
L335926 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's got to make sense some way.
L335925 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
L335924 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
L335923 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Where, how?
L335922 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I better keep looking.
L335921 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Then, close the case.
L335920 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
L335919 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
L335916 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I believed her, Pete.
L335915 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
L336048 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Goodbye, Pete.
L336047 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ Thank you. Goodbye, John.
L336046 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ All right.
L336045 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
L336044 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I wanted to give it to you first.
L336043 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
L336042 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's in the report.
L336041 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ Have you discussed this with them?
L336040 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
L336039 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
L336036 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
L336035 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ What's in it?
L336034 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
L336033 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's not so bad.
L336032 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
L336031 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
L336030 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ John, how are you?
L335781 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
L335780 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
L335779 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
L335778 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
L335777 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
L335776 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ She told me.
L335775 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
L335774 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
L335773 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
L335772 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Two years ago? Sorry.
L335771 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
L335770 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
L335769 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I've just got a few --
L335768 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
L335658 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
L335657 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I think she's trying that.
L335656 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
L335655 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Has she talked with you since prison?
L335654 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
L335653 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Did she talk about him to you?
L335652 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ Not unusual.
L335651 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
L335650 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ -- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
L336089 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
L336088 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
L336078 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
L336077 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
L336076 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
L335558 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
L335557 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No.
L335556 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
L335555 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Everybody's got some, I guess.
L335554 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
L335553 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No.
L335552 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
L335551 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No.
L335550 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
L335549 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ We grew up together. Kids.
L335548 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
L335547 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I know Tom Grunemann.
L335546 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Then how are you involved?
L335545 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Town Police.
L335544 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
L335543 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
L336087 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
L336086 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Nobody's seen that.
L336085 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
L336084 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I left them here. I was doing some work here.
L336083 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
L336027 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I don't believe Tom's alive.
L336026 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
L336025 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
L336024 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ What else do you know?
L336023 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
L336022 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
L336021 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
L336018 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
L336017 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
L336016 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ Think this is our guy?
L335952 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L335951 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ Well?
L335950 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I looked it up.
L335949 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
L335918 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
L335917 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
L335633 +++$+++ u6214 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ TRASK +++$+++ Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
L335632 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ That's a lot of people to die unknown.
L335582 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
L335581 +++$+++ u6213 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ STREIGER +++$+++ We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
L335580 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Yes sir, we know he --
L335579 +++$+++ u6213 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ STREIGER +++$+++ Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
L335578 +++$+++ u6213 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ STREIGER +++$+++ Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
L335577 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
L335576 +++$+++ u6213 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ STREIGER +++$+++ Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
L335575 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
L335571 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Trask --
L335570 +++$+++ u6213 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ STREIGER +++$+++ Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
L335567 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
L335566 +++$+++ u6213 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ STREIGER +++$+++ Are you closing the case?
