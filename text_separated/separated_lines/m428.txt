L362843 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --

L362607 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
L362606 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
L362605 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Eight o'clock?
L362604 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
L362603 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
L362602 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I thought you were flirting with me a little.
L362601 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Yeah.
L362600 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Really?
L362599 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
L362598 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
L362597 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No.
L362596 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Well...is that illegal?
L362595 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Please, yes.
L362594 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You wanna go on a date with me?
L362593 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
L362592 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What is it?  Did you forget something?
L362591 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I'm sorry, Claudia.
L362590 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Good bye.

L362586 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
L362585 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
L362584 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L362583 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
L362582 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ If you're not here for a 422 --
L362581 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
L362580 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
L362579 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ This is my job.
L362578 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
L362577 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ What's that stand for?
L362576 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ --- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
L362535 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Thank you.
L362534 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
L362533 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Ok, ok. I'm back.
L362344 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Okey-doke.
L362343 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
L362342 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
L362341 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You won't.  You won't have to.
L362340 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
L362339 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
L362338 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
L362337 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ It's not -- what's a 422?
L362336 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
L362335 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ -- is not my boyfriend.
L362334 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ The gentleman who came to the door --
L362333 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I don't have a boyfriend.
L362332 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Is this boyfriend bothering you?
L362331 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Arlight, then.  Cheers.
L362330 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yeah.
L362329 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
L362328 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You take cream or sugar?
L362327 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
L362326 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
L362325 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ That's great, thank you.
L362324 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ -- do you wanna cup?
L362323 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
L362322 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
L362321 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ got some coffee brewing, huh?
L362162 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I don't have a boyfriend.
L362161 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
L362160 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yeah.
L362159 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I'm a bit of a slob myself.
L362158 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yeah.
L362157 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Bit messy.
L362156 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ About two years ago.
L362155 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You just move in here?
L362154 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ ok.
L362153 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
L362152 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What are you lookin' for?
L362151 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ It's fine.
L362150 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You mind if I check things back here?
L362149 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
L362148 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Who was it?
L362147 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No.
L362146 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You don't have a boyfriend?

L362144 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Was it a boyfriend of yours?
L362143 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
L362142 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
L362141 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No.
L362138 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
L362137 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yeah.
L362136 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
L362135 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I didn't realize it was that loud.
L362134 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
L362133 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No.
L362132 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ -- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?

L362129 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What?

L362120 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
L362119 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ For what?
L362116 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No one else in there with you?

I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
L361742 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
L361741 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I need to sit down.
L361740 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ Do you wanna sit down?
L361739 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
L361738 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
L361737 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
L361736 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
L361735 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yeah.
L361734 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
L361733 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He has Phil right now.
L361732 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
L361731 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
L361730 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
L361729 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
L362755 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ ....getthat on the tv....there...
L362754 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What?  Say it again...walking in the car?

So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?

I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."

In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?

L361663 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
L361662 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ ...cocksucker....
L361661 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ There's no asshole like you.
L361660 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Other fuckin' assholes like me.
L361659 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I've seen it before.
L361658 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ "yeah."  the fuck do you know?
L361657 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Yeah.
L361656 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?

L361653 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ When was the last time you talked to your son?
L361652 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ ...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
L361651 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ She loves you.
L361650 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
L361649 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
L361648 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
L361647 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm trying.
L361646 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Get a girlfriend.
L361645 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No.
L361644 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
L361643 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Where is he?
L361642 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ ...ah...
L361641 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You do?
L361640 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ ...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
L361553 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
L361552 +++$+++ u6428 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
L361551 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ How's today then?
L361700 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ Yep.
L361699 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Alright.  Thank you.
L361698 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
L361697 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Is this 509-9027?
L361696 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ No.
L361695 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
L361694 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ I think you have the wrong number.
L361693 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Hi.  Is Frank there?
L361692 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ Hello?
L362692 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- fuck you.
L362691 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
L362690 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.
L362689 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ So you sat it out, that's what you did?
L362688 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
L362630 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm quietly judging you.
L362629 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Yeah.
L362628 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What am I doing?
L362627 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
L362472 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
L362471 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And that's what you've heard?
L362470 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
L362469 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Go ahead and waste your time.
L362468 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
L362467 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
L362466 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ She lived in Tarzana.
L362465 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mm. Hm.
L362464 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ She does.  From when you were a boy.
L362463 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
L362462 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Do you remember a Miss Simms?
L362461 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
L362460 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
L362459 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
L362458 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
L362457 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Not really.
L362456 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ It's all important --
L362455 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
L362454 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
L362453 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ In aid of what?
L362452 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
L362451 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L362450 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Are you asking me that?
L362449 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
L362448 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ This isn't meant --
L362447 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
L362446 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I would just want to clear some things up:
L362445 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ So boring, so useless --
L362444 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ -- just to clarify --
L362443 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is that still lingering?
L362442 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I'm confused about your past is the thing.
L362441 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Muffy -- coffee?
L362440 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ -- let's talk more about your background --
L362439 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I warned you -- I get on a roll...
L362438 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
L362437 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
L362436 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Let's talk about --
L362435 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
L362302 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Like I said, yeah --
L362301 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ -- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
L362026 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
L362025 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
L362024 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I'm gonna start rolling --
L362023 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
L362022 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ All it takes is one second?
L362019 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You got us a room so quick?
L362018 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
L362017 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
L362016 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
L362476 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
L362475 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Are you asking me a question?
L362316 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
L362315 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Kind of.
L362314 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
L362313 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ They wouldn't?
L362312 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
L362311 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
L362310 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ "Frank" was my mother's father.
L362309 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ And "Frank?"

L362307 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ It's not your given name, right?
L362306 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What name?  My name?
L362305 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Where does that name come from?
L362304 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
L362303 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
L362271 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ In five years?

L362264 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Not a problem.
L362263 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I wouldn'tve asked --
L362262 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ people die.
L362261 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I'm sorry.

L362259 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ And your father?
L362258 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ "Go Get 'Em, Honey."
L362257 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
L362256 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's my mother.
L362255 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Are you close?
L362254 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's retired.
L362253 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Does you mother still work?
L362252 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well I guess it doesn't.
L362251 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Why does that sound silly?
L362250 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
L362249 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ And what did your parents do?

L361610 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.

L361584 +++$+++ u6439 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ MARCIE +++$+++ I don't have to answer your questions.
L361583 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?

L362973 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I don't know what I've done.
L362972 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
L362970 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ ...I don't know...
L362969 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
L362968 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ <u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
L362967 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But you can't say....
L362966 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I really don't know.

L362961 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Did you ever touch her?
L362960 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
L362959 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
L362958 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.

L362916 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
L362915 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
L362914 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not through asking my questions.

L362905 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
L362904 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Is it over 'cause you're sick?
L362903 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
L362902 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What about now?
L362901 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Two years...three years...

L362888 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'll answer anything.
L362887 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
L362886 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.

L362840 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?

L362835 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
L362834 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
L362833 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No.  No.
L362832 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'm a bad person.
L362831 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're my handsome man.
L362830 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Do you love me, Rose?
L362829 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
L362828 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ How do we do this, then?
L362826 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's not really pain.
L362825 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It'll take the pain away.
L362824 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I don't think I want that.

L361961 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'm drinking.
L361960 +++$+++ u6447 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ How you doing?
L361798 +++$+++ u6441 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ MIDDLE AGED GUY +++$+++ It's alright.
L361797 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L361760 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'II go....is it...back here?
L361759 +++$+++ u6441 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ MIDDLE AGED GUY +++$+++ Want me to wake her up?
L361758 +++$+++ u6441 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ MIDDLE AGED GUY +++$+++ Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
L361757 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Can I come in?
L361756 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'm her father.
L361755 +++$+++ u6441 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ MIDDLE AGED GUY +++$+++ No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?

L362073 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
L362072 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
L362057 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Saucy-saucy.
L362056 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
L362055 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
L362054 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ No.  But I probably will get a call back.
L362053 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Was it a call back?
L362038 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
L362037 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ Do you still have to do homework?
L362640 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
L362639 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
L362069 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ No they don't --
L362068 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ They look pretty smart, I think.
L362052 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
L362051 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ What's MOW?
L362050 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
L362046 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Like what?
L362045 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
L362044 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ No.
L362043 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ Do you have an agent, Stanley?
L362520 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.
L362519 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Let me call you a car, Linda.
L362518 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I have to go.
L362517 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Linda --
L362516 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
L362515 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ You need to sober up.
L362514 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
L362513 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ I'm trying to help, Linda --
L362512 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.
L362511 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
L362510 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
L362509 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ -- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
L362508 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
L362507 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
L362506 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What does that mean?
L362505 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
L362504 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Where will the money go?
L362503 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
L362502 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I can't.
L362501 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
L362500 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
L362499 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
L362498 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
L362490 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
L362489 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
L362488 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
L362487 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
L362486 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
L362485 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
L362484 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
L362483 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Are you on drugs right now?
L362482 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
L362481 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ You don't want any water?
L362737 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
