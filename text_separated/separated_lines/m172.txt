L485451 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Alex, what are you doing?
L485450 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, I won't let you do it.
L485364 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ha! Right bitch!
L485363 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I think he wants me.
L485362 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
L485353 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Wife?!
L485352 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I found a picture of his wife.
L485351 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
L485350 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
L484949 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
L484948 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
L484947 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That's always tough. How long were you together?
L484946 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
L484945 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Are you okay?
L484968 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
L484967 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's it.
L484966 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ In room "302" at ten o'clock?
L484965 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Me, too. 101?
L484955 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
L484954 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Do I know you?
L484953 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hey, Brenda.
L485480 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Would you die already?!
L485479 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ My favorite memory was when we --
L485477 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Never happened!
L485476 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
L485475 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Okay... maybe that would be best.
L485474 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh... I guess I'll die now.
L485473 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
L485472 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
L485612 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
L485611 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Cindy, what's going on?
L485527 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Okay.
L485526 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
L485522 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hey, I have an idea...
L485521 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
L485514 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ What?! What is it, a monster?!
L485513 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ It's coming!
L485512 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
L485511 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh my God! We're dead!
L485508 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
L485507 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Help!
L485153 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
L485152 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
L485151 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Ouch!!
L484964 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Psychology.
L484963 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
L484962 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Thanks.
L484961 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
L484960 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Really? That's amazing.
L484959 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
L484958 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
L484957 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
L484956 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
L485148 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
L485147 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
L485146 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
L485145 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
L485144 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
L485143 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
L485142 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
L485649 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Okay.
L485648 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Ray, run faster.
L485491 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
L485490 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Where's Shorty?
L485435 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ He's so brave.
L485434 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's right. I should go first.
L485252 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
L485251 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
L485243 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, me too.
L485242 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
L485241 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You sure?
L485240 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ No, stay.
L485239 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So, I guess I can go now.
L485238 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
L485237 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
L485236 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Ray, have you been here all this time?
L485235 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Shhh... It's okay.
L485024 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Hello Ray.
L485023 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hello Brenda.
L485724 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hot dogs.
L485723 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I don't care. You pick.
L485722 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What should we get?
L485721 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
L485720 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
L485719 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hey, wanna' share a soda?
L485718 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ That's what your man is supposed to do.
L485717 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
L485716 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hey, look out, a bee!
L485715 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Let's get a hot dog.
L485714 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
L485713 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
L485712 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Then what are we going to do?
L485711 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
L485710 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh.
L485709 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
L485708 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Look, what I'm trying to say --
L485707 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Look, what I'm trying to say --
L485706 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Listen to me I --
L485705 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Listen to me I --
L485704 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I know, but I've been thinking --
L485703 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I know, but I've been thinking --
L485702 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
L485701 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
L485700 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
L485699 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There's something I really want to share with you.
L485639 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
L485638 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
L485637 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Cindy, let me...
L485563 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Well... okay... but only as a friend.
L485562 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
L485561 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
L485560 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Better try a little higher.
L485559 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ No. Keep rubbing.
L485558 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Feel that?
L485557 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ No. Try a little higher.
L485556 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Can you feel that?
L485555 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
L485544 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Shit!
L485543 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ He's here.
L485542 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
L485541 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What about you, Buddy?
L485540 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Huh?
L485539 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
L485538 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Great!!!
L485537 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ We should act out our inner most fantasies.
L485536 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I was thinking the same thing.
L485535 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
L485534 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes...
L485533 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That we should take our friendship a little further?
L485532 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
L485531 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
L485530 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
L485505 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hugh Kane.
L485504 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
L485501 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
L485500 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Let's get outta here.
L485499 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ It looks like the furnace.
L485498 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Where the hell are we?
L485232 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Alright!
L485231 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
L485230 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
L485229 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
L485228 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
L485225 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Shhh!
L485224 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Dude, somebody's on the rag.
L485222 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
L485221 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Buddy...
L485219 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Okay.
L485218 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Sure. We can practice talking.
L485217 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
L485216 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
L485215 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
L485214 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Then what kinda stuff can we do?
L485213 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
L485212 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
L485211 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
L485088 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Open chest!!!
L485087 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hi Buddy.
L485044 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Okay. See you later, friend.
L485043 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
L485042 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
L485041 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
L485040 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Maybe we can study together or something.
L485039 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L485038 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
L485037 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
L485036 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I meant you're into ghosts.
L485035 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ No. I never date outside my race.
L485034 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ So, I see you're really into spooks.
L485033 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Thanks. I'm Cindy.
L485032 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hey, you left your book back there.
L485455 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That means more screen time for us.
L485454 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ But he'll kill her!
L485453 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Let her go, Cin.
L485361 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ She killed herself a week before he died.
L485360 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ So, whatever happened to her?
L485359 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Okay, I get the point.
L485282 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Thanks, I'll be fine.
L485281 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
L485272 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What, you think I did this to myself?
L485271 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
L485268 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
L485267 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I think so.
L485266 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Are you okay?
L485651 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, I broke my fall.
L485650 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
L485573 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
L485572 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Where's Shorty?
L485570 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Right behind you.
L485569 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
L485568 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
L485567 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
L485566 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
L485108 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
L485107 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ How about these buns?
L485022 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
L485021 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
L485020 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, right.
L485019 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's the sequel.
L485018 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
L485017 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's okay.
L485016 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
L485733 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Yes!!!!
L485732 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Noooo!!!
L485731 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
L485730 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ This can't be happening?
L485729 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
L485728 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Both of them?
L485727 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
L485726 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ It was you...
L485608 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Made you say it!
L485607 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Stop! --
L485606 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Not in a thousand years.
L485605 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
L485598 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Um, I'm not touching anything.
L485597 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Stop touching his brain!
L485592 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
L485591 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hanson, please.
L485579 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
L485578 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
L485113 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Thanks. I made them by hand.
L485112 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Ummm!! They smell delicious.
L485061 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ I'm Hanson the caretaker.
L485060 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm Cindy.
L485057 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
L485056 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh my God! I'm here with the...
L485641 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Alright, let's take a vote...
L485640 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
L485636 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'll go.
L485635 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
L485429 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ We have to destroy him.
L485428 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What are we gonna do?
L485424 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Quick, everyone to the lab.
L485423 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
L485185 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Just wait, you'll see.
L485184 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L485030 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I don't need your help.
L485029 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Would you like me to help you pass them back?
L485677 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ Soon, but first I must bless this house.
L485676 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
L485675 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L485674 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ No, my friends are right here!
L485673 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ My child you are the only survivor.
L485672 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
L485671 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ We? What do you mean... we?
L485670 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yes, we made it!
L485669 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ My child, you're alive!
L485668 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Father!
L485663 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
L485662 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
L485661 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Hey, y'all! What's going on?
L485585 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
L485584 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Are you?
L485583 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
L485582 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
L485181 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
L485180 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Uh, uh.
L485179 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Did you do that?
L485178 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ I told you it would taste just like chicken.
L485177 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That was a great idea, Shorty.
L485176 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Hey, I got an idea.
L485175 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
L485174 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Aww, the little bird died.
L484918 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
L484917 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Am I cool now?
L484912 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
L484911 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
L484910 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
L484909 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yo! That jacket is tight.
L484908 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
L484907 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
L484905 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
L484904 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh.
L484903 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Gear. You know, clothing.
L484902 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Huh?
L484901 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
L484900 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
L484899 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
L484898 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ You could use the grade, huh?
L484897 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ I don't know, but I sure hope so.
L484896 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ So, do you think you made it into the class?
L485301 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Don't touch me!!
L485300 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Saw who?!
L485299 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
L485297 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Who?
L485296 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I think she's starting to suspect something?
L485295 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
L485294 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I don't like this, this...
L485293 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I wouldn't go that far.
L485292 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I take it you're not mad at me.
L485287 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
L485286 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Got a problem with that?
L485280 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
L485279 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
L485275 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
L485274 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What are you getting at, Professor?
L485273 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
L485270 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Theo, did you see the animal?
L485269 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm telling you, it was possessed.
L485190 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
L485189 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I got it!
L485188 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Got my camera right here.
L485187 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
L485186 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
L485183 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
L485182 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
L485140 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
L485139 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Professor, what's the history of this house?
L485094 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
L485093 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
L485409 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ The keys. She took the keys.
L485408 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
L485407 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I can do it myself.
L485311 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
L485310 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
L485309 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ That's why we came here, remember?
L485308 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
L485307 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ What?
L485306 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
L485305 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ What is it, Dwight?
L485304 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Professor, we need to talk.
L485303 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
L485302 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ What the hell?!
L485171 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
L485170 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
L485169 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Are you sure it's not the tape?
L485168 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ The image there.
L485167 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
L485166 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
L485165 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Professor, I think you should see this.
L485161 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
L485160 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ My God! Is she dead?
L485101 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
L485100 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
L485099 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
L485082 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
L485081 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
L485077 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
L485076 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ That one.
L485075 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
L485074 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Even in the bathroom?
L485073 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Yes, I thought that it would be best.
L485072 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Are those cameras all throughout the house?
L485071 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
L485070 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Fine.  What's all this stuff?
L485069 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Would you please focus?
L485068 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
L485067 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Professor!
L485066 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Right. What about condoms?
L485065 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
L485009 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
L485008 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ In about fifteen minutes.
L485007 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
L485006 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
L485005 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
L485004 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ How are we going to get them all up there?
L485003 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
L485002 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
L485001 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
L484999 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ What's this?
L484998 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
L484997 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
L484996 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
L484995 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
L484994 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
L484993 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
L484992 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
L484991 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Any of them hot?
L484990 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
L484989 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Are these all the subjects?
L484988 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Here you go, Professor.
L484987 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
L484986 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Let me help you.
L484985 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
L484984 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Let me see the files.
L484983 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I finished all the interviews.
L485459 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Alright. Come on, you guys.
L485458 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She's right. We should stick together.
L485389 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Oh, I couldn't do that.
L485388 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
L485387 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ That's right.
L485386 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
L485382 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Just a little Rogaine.
L485381 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
L485380 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Of course. So sexy.
L485379 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ And sexy.
L485378 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
L485377 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ You do.
L485376 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
L485375 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
L485374 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
L485373 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Just a little experiment.
L485372 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What are you working on?
L485371 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Hi.
L485370 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Hello Dwight.
L485123 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
L485122 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
L485121 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Yours, or the turkeys?
L485120 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
L485080 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
L485079 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Thanks, handyman.
L485078 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
L485679 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I guess so.
L485678 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You mean to tell me we're dead!
L485625 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Alright, go to the belt store...
L485624 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're not wearing a belt.
L485623 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Okay, give me my belt.
L485622 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
L485621 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ A little bit... Give me your belt.
L485620 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ My help?
L485619 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Alright... I might need your help.
L485617 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
L485616 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You never could feel your legs.
L485092 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Second best.
L485091 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
L484832 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
L484831 +++$+++ u2643 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
L484830 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ How is she?
L484829 +++$+++ u2643 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It's okay. I understand.
L484828 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
L484827 +++$+++ u2643 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'm so glad you're here.
L484826 +++$+++ u2643 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Father, come in, please.
L484825 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ Uh... I'm Father McFeely
L484879 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ No, I'm fine.
L484878 +++$+++ u2641 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HARRIS +++$+++ Father, I think you should rest.
L484871 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ My holy water.
L484870 +++$+++ u2641 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HARRIS +++$+++ No thanks.
L484861 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ What she said about your mother?
L484860 +++$+++ u2641 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HARRIS +++$+++ What?
L484859 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ Oh shit, you gonna take that?
L484847 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
L484846 +++$+++ u2641 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HARRIS +++$+++ Because she will lie?
L484845 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
L484844 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ Then let us prepare.
L484843 +++$+++ u2641 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HARRIS +++$+++ Yes.
L484842 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
L484841 +++$+++ u2641 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HARRIS +++$+++ Father, are you okay?
L484837 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ Soon. First, I must bless this house.
L484836 +++$+++ u2641 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HARRIS +++$+++ Would you like to see the girl?
L484834 +++$+++ u2639 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ FATHER MCFEELY +++$+++ Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
L484833 +++$+++ u2641 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HARRIS +++$+++ Father.
L485604 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
L485603 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ This part removes the sense of humor.
L485601 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
L485600 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Shorty, why don't you say grace?

L485581 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
L485580 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Sit down and join us, Cindy.
L485698 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't worry, I got your back.
