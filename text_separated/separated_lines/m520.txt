L517125 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ $1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
L517124 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
L517123 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Oh, yeh?
L517122 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
L517118 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
L517117 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
L517114 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
L517113 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
L517112 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
L517111 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
L516851 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ ...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
L516850 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
L516849 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
L516846 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You don't.
L516845 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ I don't know.
L516844 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
L516843 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
L516842 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ None.
L516841 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
L516840 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
L516839 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
L516838 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ That's obvious.
L516837 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
L516836 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
L516835 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
L516834 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ Carl Heine's type.
L516833 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
L516590 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
L516589 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
L516588 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
L516587 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
L516586 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
L516578 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
L516577 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
L516576 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
L516575 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
L516548 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
L516547 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Why?  If they could never take title.
L516546 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
L516545 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
L516538 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
L516537 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
L516536 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
L516602 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ You done your math right.
L516601 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ It is.
L516600 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Is that your third question?
L516599 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
L516598 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ A thousand.
L516597 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
L516596 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
L516595 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
L517079 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
L517078 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
L517077 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
L517076 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, what if?
L517075 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
L517074 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
L517073 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
L517072 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
L517071 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
L517070 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
L517069 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
L517068 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
L517067 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
L517066 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
L517065 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
L517064 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
L517063 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
L517062 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now, Mister Gi...
L517059 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ I said.  No further questions.
L517058 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ You're implying th...
L517057 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Question withdrawn, you may step down.
L517055 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ It seems human.  To me.
L517054 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
L517053 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, it seems to me...
L517052 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
L517051 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
L517050 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
L517049 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
L517048 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
L517047 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Why not?
L517046 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ We discussed that.  And decided not to.
L517043 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
L517042 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
L517041 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
L517040 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
L517039 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
L517037 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
L517036 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Closer to eight.
L517035 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
L517034 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
L517032 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
L517031 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Happy for him.  And relieved.
L517030 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
L517029 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
L517197 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
L517196 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I did.  But the jury won't s...
L517195 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Did you write that column?
L516968 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
L516967 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
L516960 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
L516959 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
L516939 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ The Japs did it.
L516938 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
L516937 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
L516922 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
L516921 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
L516684 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
L516683 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
L516680 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
L516679 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
L516667 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
L516666 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
L516665 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
L516664 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I can just feel my spirits soar.
L516531 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Why?  We're only talking.
L516530 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ My mom.  Would be the problem.
L516529 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
L516528 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
L516527 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
L516507 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Easy.  Slow is best.
L516506 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
L516505 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
L516504 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
L516994 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ ...but he found you.
L516993 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
L516988 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Those aren't the facts that matter.
L516987 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
L516986 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
L516985 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
L516984 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
L516983 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
L516979 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
L516978 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You don't believe in God anymore.
L516874 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ Oh, in a heartbeat.
L516873 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
L516872 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
L516871 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, what then, sergeant?
L516860 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
L516859 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
L516858 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
L516857 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
L516856 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
L516796 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Pretty darn clear.
L516795 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
L516794 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
L516793 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
L516792 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
L516791 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And the last...?
L516790 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
L516789 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And the next one...?
L516788 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
L516361 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
L516360 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
L516349 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
L516348 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
L516429 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.

L516427 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
L516426 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And why.  Is that?
L516425 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
L516424 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Did you say more?
L516423 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
L516422 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ ...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
L517286 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Tht was summation, Your H...
L517285 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
L517154 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Objection!
L517153 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
L516592 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
L516591 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
L516384 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
L516383 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
L516382 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
L517353 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
L517352 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ <u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
L517351 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
L517350 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
L517340 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
L517339 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
L517337 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ He didn't want to lose any more.
L517336 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Greedy.
L517332 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Like you couldn't believe.
L517331 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
L517328 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L517327 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
L517326 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
L517324 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
L517323 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
L517321 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Twelve.
L517320 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
L517319 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
L517318 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ <u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
L517284 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Objection!  Speculation.
L517283 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
L516612 +++$+++ u7703 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ OLE +++$+++ He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
L516611 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
L516610 +++$+++ u7703 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ OLE +++$+++ Carl Heine came.
L516609 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
L516608 +++$+++ u7703 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ OLE +++$+++ Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
L516607 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
L516606 +++$+++ u7703 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ OLE +++$+++ Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
L516605 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Robbed.  He was angry.
L517150 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
L517149 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
L517148 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Yes.
L517147 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
L517146 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
L517145 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
L517144 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
L517143 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I have told the truth.
L517142 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
L517140 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
L517139 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
L517138 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
L517137 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Yes.  Initially.
L517136 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
L517135 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
L517131 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
L517130 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ As my wife testified, we were considering it.
L516952 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
L516951 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
L516950 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
L516949 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You mean, early morning the 16th?
L516948 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
L516947 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ How long you have this detail?
L516932 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
L516931 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
L516930 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
L516929 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You have the night watch?  On the radio.
L517240 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
L517239 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
L517235 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You're right.  I better use two.
L517234 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You gonna climb that with one arm?
L517232 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Have a look.  At nothing.
L517231 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
L517223 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
L517222 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
L517206 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Won't take two.
L517205 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You said three minutes.
L516367 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Three kids.  What's she going to do?
L516366 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I did.  Boy.
L517377 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
L517376 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ We don't let go, you s...
L517368 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
L517367 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You ever been strangled by a single hand?
L517366 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
L517364 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I'll take two.  One for later.
L517363 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Cigarette?
L517312 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, anything coulda caused that.
L517311 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
L517310 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You think so?
L517309 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ He hit his head.  On the way in.
L517308 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
L517307 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
L517306 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
L517299 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ The knife.  What knife?
L517298 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
L517297 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
L517296 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
L517295 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Maybe...?
L517294 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
L517293 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
L517292 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
L517291 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Still lashed to the mast.
L517290 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
L517289 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Fell.
L517288 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ That's when he fell.
L517281 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
L517280 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, why does it?
L517279 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
L517278 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
L517277 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
L517276 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
L517271 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ To my father.  Everything counts.
L517270 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
L517269 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Yes, he was.
L517268 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
L517267 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
L517266 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You're wondering why I held it.
L517265 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ This tastes horrible, hmmn?
L517262 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ No, you don't.
L517261 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It's the way it happened, I know it is.
L516819 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
L516818 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
L516816 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
L516815 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
L516810 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
L516809 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Naw, I had that around for a while.
L516808 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
L516805 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I was checking the cables.
L516804 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You always run with the well open?
L516800 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
L516799 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ What for, Sheriff?
L517103 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ And what do you believe?
L517102 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
L517101 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
L517100 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I want you.  To tell the truth.
L517099 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You want me to say that.
L517096 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
L517095 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
L517092 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
L517091 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ And what's that?
L516660 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I should show them an American?
L516659 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
L516657 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
L516656 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
L516643 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
L516642 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You wouldn't even see it move.
L516641 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
L516640 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
L516638 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I think you like learning.
L516637 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You must think I like losing.
L516635 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
L516634 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ White or black?
L516632 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
L516631 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ What makes you think I play?
L516831 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ <u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
L516830 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
L516829 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ What else could it be?
L516828 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
L516827 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
L516825 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
L516824 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ And her farmhouse...?
L516823 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
L516822 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
L516421 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Possible.  But not darn likely.
L516420 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
L516419 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
L516418 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
L516417 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
L516416 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I don't think so.
L516415 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
L516414 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
L516413 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I believe so.
L516412 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
L516411 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Apparently.
L516410 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
L516409 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ No.
L516408 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ No spare.
L516407 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
L516406 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
L516404 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
L516403 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
L516402 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
L516401 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
L516400 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ It is.
L516399 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
L516398 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You have to wonder.
L516397 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
L516396 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Does it now?
L516395 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
L516394 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
L516393 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
L516392 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
L516391 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Maybe.
L516390 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
L516389 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
L516464 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ <u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
L516463 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Are you absol...
L516462 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most.
L516461 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
L516460 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Can I say something, here?
L516459 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ For the third time, yes.
L516458 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
L516457 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ For certain, no.
L516456 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ <u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
L516455 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ I already said that, b...
L516454 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
L516453 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Sure, anything's poss...
L516452 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Is it possible?
L516451 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
L516450 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
L516449 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ The same.
L516448 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
L516447 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Obviously.
L516446 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
L516444 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
L516443 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Well...
L516442 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
L516441 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
L516439 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
L516438 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
L516907 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ That's all he said.
L516906 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
L516905 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
L516904 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
L516902 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
L516901 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ I can't speak for him.
L516900 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
L516899 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ He had no reason to.
L516898 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
L516897 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
L516896 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ Carl never lied.
L516895 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
L516893 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
L516892 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ Not in those words.
L516891 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
L516890 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ I wouldn't say encouraged.
L516889 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
