L225815 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
L225814 +++$+++ u5403 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ABEL +++$+++ I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
L225813 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ What is that?
L225811 +++$+++ u5403 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ABEL +++$+++ Drop me off?  How do you mean?
L225810 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
L225809 +++$+++ u5403 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ABEL +++$+++ Going?  How do you mean?
L225808 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Where are you going?
L225807 +++$+++ u5403 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ABEL +++$+++ My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
L226011 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
L226010 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You're all just jealous.
L226007 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I did?!  I broke the world's record.
L226006 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
L226005 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ ... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
L225988 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
L225987 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Who brought up this bright idea?
L225877 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
L225876 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ No more... I can't!
L225744 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
L225743 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
L225742 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Same thing.
L225741 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
L225740 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
L226063 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Sure.
L226062 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Do you want a beer or not?
L226060 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ What?
L226059 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
L226058 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Barely.
L226057 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Hey Deb... can you hear me?
L226056 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You're too clean for me.
L226055 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
L226054 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What're you doin'?
L226052 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I vote for the hammock.
L226051 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I vote for me.
L226050 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
L226024 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I'll think of something.
L226023 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Think you can figure it out?
L226022 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
L226021 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
L226020 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ How do we do it?
L225990 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ If you insist.
L225989 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
L225982 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
L225981 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ How about a roll in the hay?
L225980 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Not now.  I'm cold.
L225979 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
L225978 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ What're you doing?
L225959 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
L225958 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
L225957 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I don't know...
L225956 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Why don't we go take a swim?
L225881 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Where's Shelly?
L225880 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ What was that?
L225785 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
L225784 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Breakfast?
L225734 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
L225733 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Cool it, Andy.
L225732 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
L225728 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
L225727 +++$+++ u5404 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What're you gonna do?
L226090 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Be a man, man.
L226089 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Will you come with me?
L226088 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
L226087 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Don't do that to me!
L226086 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
L226085 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What's the matter?!
L226084 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ It's Friday the 13th.
L226083 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I can't even remember what day it is, man.
L226082 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
L225944 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ This is all the exercise I need...
L225943 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Maybe we should do some exercise.
L225851 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
L225850 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
L225849 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It's dark down there.
L225798 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I love you, man!
L225797 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm a slow eater.
L225795 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Chuck... look.
L225794 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
L225779 +++$+++ u5405 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yes, man!
L225778 +++$+++ u5407 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
L225863 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Have you ever made love in a hammock?
L225862 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ A hammock?
L225861 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Your bed.
L225860 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ What's this?
L225825 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You go ahead...
L225824 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Come on down!
L225749 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
L225748 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What are they saying?
L225738 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
L225737 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
L225724 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
L225723 +++$+++ u5408 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Which one is it?
L226074 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Sort of.
L226073 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ You know him?
L226071 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Sure, just watch where you're going.
L226070 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Could we move a little faster?
L226027 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
L226026 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
L226004 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
L226003 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You promised you'd never ask me.
L226002 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ What happened that night?
L226001 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
L226000 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
L225999 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
L225998 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ And, what about us?
L225997 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ ... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
L225996 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Why did you come back here?
L225995 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
L225994 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ What do you mean?
L225993 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ It's deceiving.
L225992 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
L225954 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
L225953 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ This is too painful to look at.
L225887 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
L225886 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
L225885 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Are you all right, Shelly?
L225884 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Shelly!  Where are you?!
L225872 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
L225871 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
L225870 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Somebody was in here.
L225869 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ No.  I got here just before you did.
L225868 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Did you stay here last night?
L225867 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Look what I found.  Remember these?
L225845 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Nothing.
L225844 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ What?
L225843 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
L225840 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
L225839 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
L225838 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ You're irresistible.  I lose control.
L225837 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I don't know.
L225836 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Is that so bad?
L225835 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
L225834 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Hello.  How are you?
L225833 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
L225832 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
L225831 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
L225830 +++$+++ u5409 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Why?
L225829 +++$+++ u5406 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Derek... stop.
L226042 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ You're wrong.
L226041 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ You don't to say it.  I can tell.
L226040 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ I never said you were "nothing".
L226039 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
L226038 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
L226037 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I just want you to like me.
L226036 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ You don't "have to."
L226035 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I have to.
L226034 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Why do you do these stupid things?!
L226033 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Damn you, Shelly!
L226032 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
L226018 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Don't say any more.
L226017 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
L225952 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
L225951 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
L225949 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ It was nothing.
L225948 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
L225942 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
L225941 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
L225940 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Stop the car!  Now!!
L225939 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Bullseye!
L225938 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ You're the boss.
L225937 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
L225936 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ What're you doing?
L225935 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Just keep your eyes on the road.
L225934 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ This is no time to celebrate!
L225933 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Maybe.
L225932 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Got any good ideas?
L225928 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Keep looking.
L225927 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I don't see anything.
L225925 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
L225924 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
L225923 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ See anything?
L225920 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Gulp!
L225919 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Yes.
L225918 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Are they following us?
L225914 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ May be please have the wallet.
L225913 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Please... be cool.
L225906 +++$+++ u5410 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
L225905 +++$+++ u5411 +++$+++ m359 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Everything's gonna be fine.
