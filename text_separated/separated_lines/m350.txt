L214882 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ No! No! Don't!
L214881 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You know what to do.
L214852 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
L214851 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Police are coming.
L214833 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Get out! Get out of the car!
L214832 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
L214829 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't do it! Don't do it!
L214828 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Carter, get out!
L214827 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Easy, Billy, just open it.
L214826 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Can't you open the door?!
L214820 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Let us out!
L214819 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Stop the car!
L214787 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
L214786 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
L214783 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
L214782 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
L214781 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Nothing is... anymore.
L214780 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
L214779 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
L214771 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Most kids never have it happen.
L214770 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Most kids do, I guess.
L214679 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
L214678 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
L214677 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
L214672 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
L214671 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
L214668 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
L214667 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Right. April 25th.
L214666 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ 4:25.
L214664 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Like... 4:25.
L214663 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Remember the departure time?
L214662 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Thirty-nine.
L214661 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ No.
L214660 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Remember the gate number?
L214659 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Thirty-nine.
L214658 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
L214657 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ As in flannels and plaids?
L214656 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
L214626 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
L214625 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
L214624 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's him, but... he's not here.
L214623 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
L214622 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That... him?
L214620 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
L214619 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ This place?!
L214616 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Then, let's go see him!
L214615 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
L214614 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Is that something you're "feeling?"
L214613 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
L214612 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ "It?"
L214611 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
L214610 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ That's why I was there last night.
L214606 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
L214605 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm... really sorry.
L214604 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
L214598 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
L214597 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
L214593 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
L214592 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's only the end of June.
L214521 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ He's not a witch.
L214520 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
L214855 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
L214854 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ "Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
L214853 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
L214850 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
L214849 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're the fuckin' devil.
L214848 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
L214810 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No!
L214809 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
L214801 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
L214800 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
L214799 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
L214785 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why do you think I was hiding?
L214784 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
L214692 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Look, there's something you should all know.
L214691 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ We're losing our favorite teacher.
L214557 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
L214556 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't.
L214555 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
L214517 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I wish you were on the plane!
L214516 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
L214490 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
L214489 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'll remove him.
L214570 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's a plan.
L214569 +++$+++ u5294 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
L214509 +++$+++ u5294 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
L214508 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
L214465 +++$+++ u5294 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
L214464 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
L214463 +++$+++ u5294 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Fag.
L214448 +++$+++ u5294 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
L214447 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
L214731 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
L214730 +++$+++ u5295 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ WEINE +++$+++ Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
L214719 +++$+++ u5295 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ WEINE +++$+++ Oh, you've noticed it, too?
L214718 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
L214717 +++$+++ u5295 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ WEINE +++$+++ "Next?"
L214716 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
L214531 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No. I saw it. I saw it!
L214530 +++$+++ u5295 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ WEINE +++$+++ Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
L214529 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
L214650 +++$+++ u5293 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ MR. BLUDWORTH +++$+++ No harm. No foul.
L214649 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm sorry we broke in.
L214645 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Design?
L214644 +++$+++ u5293 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ MR. BLUDWORTH +++$+++ You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
L214642 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You saying Tod did kill himself?
L214641 +++$+++ u5293 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ MR. BLUDWORTH +++$+++ ... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
L214640 +++$+++ u5293 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ MR. BLUDWORTH +++$+++ In Death...
L214639 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
L214637 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
L214636 +++$+++ u5293 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ MR. BLUDWORTH +++$+++ Cuticle lacerations.
L214632 +++$+++ u5293 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ MR. BLUDWORTH +++$+++ I know who you are.
L214631 +++$+++ u5289 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
L214838 +++$+++ u5290 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ No one's that strong.
L214837 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It broke!
L214796 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
L214795 +++$+++ u5290 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
L214794 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
L214793 +++$+++ u5290 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
L214763 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ 'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
L214762 +++$+++ u5290 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
L214761 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
L214760 +++$+++ u5290 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ And don't pass on the right.
L214842 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
L214841 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ SHUT UP, BILLY!
L214817 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
L214816 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
L214815 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's what I'm doin'!
L214814 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Get control of yourself!
L214806 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Not with us in the fuckin' car!
L214805 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ May as well go out under my own free will, right?
L214804 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Knock it off!
L214798 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You have a responsibility to tell me.
L214797 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
L214754 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
L214753 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
L214752 +++$+++ u5291 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Terry's name should be on this wall.
L214751 +++$+++ u5292 +++$+++ m350 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ What are you doing?
