L147565 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
L147564 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
L147544 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
L147543 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
L147394 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
L147393 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
L147392 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
L147391 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
L147390 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You didn't have to kill Sophie.
L147389 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
L147388 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
L147386 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
L147385 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ They don't have a murder weapon?
L147384 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
L147383 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
L147382 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ A pass.
L147381 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
L147380 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Where are the tapes?
L147379 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
L147378 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
L147377 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
L147376 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
L147375 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You killed her!
L147374 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
L147373 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Wired?    I ain't wired.
L147372 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
L147371 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What are you doing?
L147360 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
L147359 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
L147358 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Do you know who this is?
L147357 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Agent Hadley.
L147161 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
L147160 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
L147159 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
L147185 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
L147184 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Too many people know about my involvement in this.
L147183 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
L147182 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I thought you wanted Zammito?
L147181 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
L147180 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
L147179 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
L147178 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
L147177 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
L147166 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ You'll never get out of the city.
L147165 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Zero.   That's all I know.
L147218 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
L147217 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
L147216 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
L147214 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ What?   This?
L147213 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Hey man, you can't do that!
L147212 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ I dunno.
L147211 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Where did they go?
L147210 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ They left about a half hour ago.
L147209 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Not today.   Where are your friends?
L147208 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
L146994 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Take what you've got and get out of there.
L146993 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Oui.
L146992 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ You've already robbed the safe?
L146991 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Should I call you back?
L146990 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ My number's going to show up on his bill!
L146989 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Oui.
L146988 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ You're calling me on is phone?
L146987 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ No.
L146986 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
L146985 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Oui.
L146984 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ You're there now?
L146983 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
L146982 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Marcel?
L146981 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ It's me...
L146980 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Who?
L146979 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ It's Elvis...
L146978 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Hello?
L147640 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
L147639 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
L147638 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
L147637 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ A million! I don't have that kind of money.
L147636 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ -- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
L147635 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
L147634 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ It's Daniel.
L147633 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Hello?
L146743 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
L146742 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You don't trust me?
L146741 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
L146740 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ What?
L146739 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
L146701 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
L146700 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ C'mon, Laurant, America?
L146699 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
L146694 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Good.   I have a job for you in America.
L146693 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Uh, yeah.
L146692 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
L146682 +++$+++ u4655 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BASTALDI +++$+++ Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
L146681 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Where's your brother?
L146860 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah -- you do that.
L146859 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
L146858 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
L146857 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ To tell you that we're interested in the property.
L146856 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Why are you here?
L146855 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ I'm not here to negotiate.
L146854 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Okay.   How much?
L146853 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
L146852 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
L146851 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
L146850 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ -- Super what?
L146849 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
L146848 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
L146847 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ I'm good.   Really.
L146846 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
L146845 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ No thank you.
L146844 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
L146843 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
L146842 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
L146841 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Good.   I'm good.
L146840 +++$+++ u4656 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BOBBY BEANS +++$+++ Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
L147292 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
L147291 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
L147290 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
L147289 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yes.
L147288 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
L147286 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
L147285 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me about this?
L146945 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
L146944 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ But you were there?
L146943 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
L146942 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
L146941 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ He missed three weeks.
L146940 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
L146938 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
L146937 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
L146936 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Uh, no --
L146935 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
L146934 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Someone else coming?
L146932 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Good word.
L146931 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
L146930 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ They're gonna be what?
L146929 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
L146928 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
L146927 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
L146926 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
L146925 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
L146924 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ And?
L146923 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
L146922 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
L146921 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ No, I'm good, Angelo.
L146920 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
L147596 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ You have something for me?
L147595 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Thank you.
L147594 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
L147541 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ How about if I call you?
L147540 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
L147539 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Where are you staying?
L147538 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
L147537 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ I only have your word for that.
L147536 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
L147535 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ And the other half?
L147534 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Half the tapes.
L147533 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ And for my help I would get what?
L147532 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ You want me to help you get out of the country?
L147531 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
L147530 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ I assume you want something?
L147529 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
L147528 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
L147527 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
L147522 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
L147521 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
L147520 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I guess we're going to find out.
L147519 +++$+++ u4657 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ BONANNO +++$+++ Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
L147158 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
L147157 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ What kind of business?
L147156 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
L147155 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ For what?
L147129 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
L147128 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L146820 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I know they won't be home tonight.
L146819 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Tonight?
L147464 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Jesus!
L147463 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
L147462 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
L147459 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I'm just setting my boundaries.
L147458 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Why is everything an argument with you?
L147457 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I'm not any closer than you are.
L147456 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Because you're the closest.
L147455 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Why do I always have to answer the phone?
L147454 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Get that, will you?
L147278 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
L147277 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Why not just steal another one?
L147174 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
L147173 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
L147163 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
L147162 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
L147106 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
L147105 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We can't.
L147104 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yeah.   We just go home.
L146816 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ No problem.
L146815 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
L146671 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
L146670 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
L147475 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
L147474 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
L147473 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ And the Vodka.
L147472 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Bring me the scissors.
L147170 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ What about the money?
L147169 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'm going to kill him myself!
L147168 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ You want Zero to kill him?
L147167 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
L147002 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Cops?
L147001 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
L146760 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
L146759 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ He said to go fuck yourself.
L146738 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We'll see.
L146737 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
L146736 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I just want you there in case there's trouble.
L146733 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ No one? Then why is Zero here?
L146732 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Hopefully no one.
L146727 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ Where are you from?
L146726 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
L147284 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We'll think of something.
L147283 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
L147276 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
L147275 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What for?
L147274 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
L146660 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
L146659 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
L146658 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I can't believe you didn't check.
L146657 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I thought they came with batteries.
L146656 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You didn't buy batteries?
L146655 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Do they come with batteries?
L146654 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
L146653 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Turn on the flashlight.
L147416 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
L147415 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We still have to get out of here.
L147410 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
L147409 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
L147408 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
L147239 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
L147238 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
L147235 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
L147234 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
L147231 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
L147230 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Do I?
L147229 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
L147224 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
L147223 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You're sure?
L147222 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ No.
L147221 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
L147099 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
L147098 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
L147022 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
L147021 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
L147020 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ That moron.
L147000 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I think he's already figured that out.
L146999 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
L146698 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
L146697 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Besides, we don't know the city and--
L147648 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
L147647 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Did you have to use that much explosive?
L147513 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You better.
L147512 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I will.
L147511 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
L147510 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Does it really matter what I say?
L147509 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You haven't answered my question.
L147508 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
L147507 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
L147506 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
L147505 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Can I trust you, Sami?
L147504 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What?
L147480 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Some bread and...
L147479 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ What'd you get?
L147478 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Anybody hungry?
L147477 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
L147476 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
L147461 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
L147460 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Hello?
L147435 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
L147434 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
L147407 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ No?
L147406 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's not your fault, Daniel.
L147257 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Has to be.
L147256 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hadley --
L147237 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
L147236 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ All right, knock it off.
L147228 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
L147227 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
L147109 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ We have to find Sophie.
L147108 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
L147107 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
L147088 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No.   Chicks dig me.
L147087 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
L147086 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
L147014 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
L147013 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
L146973 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
L146972 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ It's not?
L146953 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I'll be Elvis and you--
L146952 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Good idea.
L146951 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
L146812 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
L146811 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
L146723 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
L146722 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ This is Zero.
L147559 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ There's just one more thing I need you to do.
L147558 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Okay, we're square now, right?
L147325 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'll tell you when it's time.
L147324 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ What?
L147323 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
L147273 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Fine.     Ten o'clock.
L147272 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
L147271 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We had a deal.
L147270 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
L147269 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ -- Did you set it up?
L147268 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
L147267 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ It's me.
L147266 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Yeah?
L147204 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Fine.
L147203 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ A thousand dollars?
L147202 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ How much?
L147201 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
L147200 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
L147199 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Why haven't you turned us in?
L147198 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
L147197 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'm from Belgium.
L147196 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
L147195 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I've got a way with people.
L147194 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
L147193 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Don't bullshit me.
L147192 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Man, I can get anything.
L147191 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Guns.   Can you get them?
L147190 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ What do you want now?
L147189 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
L147114 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Hard to say.
L147113 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
L147041 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
L147040 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
L147039 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Hector, don't interrupt me.
L147038 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
L146905 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ -- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
L146904 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I just thought that--
L146903 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
L146902 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Maybe you should call the police.
L147593 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Great fuckin' song.
L147592 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Good song though.
L147591 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
L147492 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.
L147491 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
L147062 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Okay boss.
L147061 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Just find them!
L147060 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
L147059 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
L147058 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Okay boss.   Where are they?
L147057 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
L147056 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
L147055 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
L147054 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Boy, you must be pissed.
L147053 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Everything.
L147052 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Everything?
L147051 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Everything.
L147050 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ What'd they take?
L147049 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah, French guys from France.
L147048 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ French guys?    You mean like from France?
L147047 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ They were all French guys.
L146866 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
L146865 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Hey boss, it's not a science.
L146804 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
L146803 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ You said don't do it, boss.
L146802 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
L147433 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Go look.
L147432 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ I don't know.     I didn't look.
L147431 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ What room number?
L147430 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ The Holiday Hotel.
L147429 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ What hotel?
L147428 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
L147427 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
L147426 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
L147425 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
L147424 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
L147423 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ And the other car?
L147422 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
L147421 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ What'd you guys find?
L147006 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Go where?   The police are outside.
L147005 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ I was told to take what we have and go.
L147004 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What do we do?
L146967 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ There must be half a million dollars here though.
L146966 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
L146965 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ There has to be.
L146919 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L146918 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
L146917 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ The map said to go left.
L147019 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
L147018 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
L147017 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Yes.
L147016 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
L147015 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L146814 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ You can use my car.
L146813 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What about transportation?
L146810 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
L146809 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
L146785 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Oh, then we will have the house wine.
L146784 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ They don't have a wine list.
L147280 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
L147279 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
L147262 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
L147261 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ We've got to get out of here.
L147260 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
L147259 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
L147258 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
L147101 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
L147100 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
L147097 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
L147096 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
L147009 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
L147008 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
L146791 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Okay.    I will have a beer.
L146790 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ This kind.
L146789 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
L146788 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ They don't serve wine here.
L146721 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
L146720 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I see.   A master criminal.
L146719 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
L146718 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What is it you do, Sami?
L146717 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
L147402 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ We both know I'm already dead.
L147401 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I'm not going to leave you.
L147400 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ When we get to the next corner jump out.
L147398 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
L147397 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I knew I should have driven.
L147369 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ This is the only American car you've ever driven.
L147368 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
L147367 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I've never driven a Cadillac before.
L147366 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I'm the driver.
L147365 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I'll drive.
L147327 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Relax. It will be fine.
L147326 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
L147079 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
L147078 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
L147437 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ What are we going to do, take a taxi?
L147436 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ How about Canada?
L147414 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
L147413 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ No.   How much?
L146679 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
L146678 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
L146677 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ What the hell is he talking about?
L146676 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
L146675 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
L146674 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
L147661 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No!
L147660 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Give it to me, Sami.
L147659 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No.
L147658 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
L147653 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
L147652 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ The baseball is mine.
L147651 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
L147485 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hey, you know you can't this in France.
L147484 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ God, I want to go home.
L147483 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's good.
L147233 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
L147232 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You guys used to work together?
L147226 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
L147225 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ "Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
L146975 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ 
L146974 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
L146971 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
L146970 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Mr. Taylor?
L146969 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
L146957 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Okay.   You can be Elvis.
L146956 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
L146955 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's my idea.
L146954 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ -- I want to be Elvis.
L146712 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
L146711 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ You lived there. You know the city.
L146710 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Me?
L146709 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
L146708 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that.
L146707 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Today's your lucky day, Sami.
L146704 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
L146703 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Going somewhere?
L147490 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
L147489 +++$+++ u4664 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ NICKY "THE RAKE" +++$+++ They sort of got away.
L147488 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ What happened?
L147298 +++$+++ u4664 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ NICKY "THE RAKE" +++$+++ Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
L147297 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Get in the car.
L147296 +++$+++ u4664 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ NICKY "THE RAKE" +++$+++ Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
L146864 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ I said a clean break.
L146863 +++$+++ u4664 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ NICKY "THE RAKE" +++$+++ He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
L146862 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ How's my brother?
L147619 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Fuck me?   Fuck you!
L147618 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Fuck you, grease-ball!
L147617 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
L147616 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
L147615 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ The hell it is.
L147614 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ No.   It's mine.
L147613 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah.   It's mine.
L147612 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Anybody know about that car outside?
L147581 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
L147580 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ No shit?
L147579 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
L147578 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L147577 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You see that car?
L147576 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ How?
L147575 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
L147574 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L147573 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
L147572 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Uh huh.
L147571 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Mr. Zammito?
L147188 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Cool.
L147187 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
L147111 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ I know where she went.
L147110 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ How are we going to do that?
L146778 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
L146777 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yeah, I dig him.
L146776 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
L146775 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ No thank you.
L146774 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
L146773 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
L147501 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Glenmorangie is very good.
L147500 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Glenmorangie.
L147499 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ J&amp;B?
L147498 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
L147497 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
L147412 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
L147411 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
L147264 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
L147263 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You're not helping.
L147241 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
L147240 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
L147127 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Where is it, Sophie?
L147126 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ The money isn't here.
L147116 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Wait here.
L147115 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ How do we know what room she's in?
L147093 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ What?
L147092 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Holy shit.
L146916 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Oh, you think?
L146915 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I think we went the wrong way.
L146901 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Watch this.
L146900 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
L146735 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Feel free to correct him if you want.
L146734 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ He speaks about himself in the third person?
L147419 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
L147418 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
L147282 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I don't know.
L147281 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ And how do we do that?
L147172 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ We don't know that for sure.
L147171 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
L147138 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You wanna tell him?
L147137 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ What does arresting us get them?
L147136 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
L146826 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
L146825 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I can't even hear myself think.
L146767 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
L146766 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
L146731 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ -- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
L146730 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
L146729 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ And you don't speak French?
L146728 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Algeria.
L147154 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
L147153 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Why?
L147131 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Stick around and find out.
L147130 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Who are you waiting for?
L147125 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ After last night I could say the same for you.
L147124 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
L147071 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
L147070 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Sounds boring.
L147069 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
L147068 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L147067 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L147066 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
L147065 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No.
L147064 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Can't sleep?
L146891 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ The lucky ones.
L146890 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Who's gonna see it there?
L146889 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
L146888 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
L146887 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
L146886 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
L146885 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ You got it in a bar?
L146884 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I don't remember.    I was drunk.
L146883 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
L146882 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You ask a lot of questions.
L146881 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
L146880 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Something like that.
L146879 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Did she break your heart?
L146878 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Something like that.
L146877 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Casandra. Old girlfriend?
L146875 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ They're not nice people.
L146874 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
L146873 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
L146872 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
L146871 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
L146870 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
L146869 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
L146868 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ You like shoes?
L146822 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Take a nap.
L146821 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You ever hear of jet lag?
L146818 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Tonight.
L146817 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ When do we go?
L146771 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Thanks.
L146770 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
L147607 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
L147606 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Okay.    Okay.
L147605 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
L147604 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
L147603 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ It's for you.
L147602 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
L147601 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ A car.
L147600 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ What's this?
L147351 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
L147350 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
L147349 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
L147348 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ A little?
L147347 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
L147346 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
L147345 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
L147344 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
L147343 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
L147342 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
L147341 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
L147340 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ She seems pleasant enough.
L146808 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ That's why we're only breaking one arm.
L146807 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
L146806 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
L146805 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Frankie, I --
