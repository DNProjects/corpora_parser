L635659 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
L635658 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
L635657 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ I didn't think they'd really do it.
L635206 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Ah, I see.
L635205 +++$+++ u8706 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
L635204 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
L635203 +++$+++ u8706 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
L635202 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
L635201 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
L635200 +++$+++ u8706 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
L635199 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
L635196 +++$+++ u8707 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
L635195 +++$+++ u8708 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
L635194 +++$+++ u8707 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
L635191 +++$+++ u8707 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Maybe he ain't so tough.
L635190 +++$+++ u8708 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
L635189 +++$+++ u8707 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ He didn't say nothin', huh?
L635186 +++$+++ u8708 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
L635185 +++$+++ u8707 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ What'd he say?
L635182 +++$+++ u8708 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ 'Course he's coming.

L635177 +++$+++ u8708 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
L635176 +++$+++ u8707 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
L635681 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
L635680 +++$+++ u8708 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
L635679 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ He give 'em names?

L634962 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ ...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?

L635563 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
L635562 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
L635561 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Me? No. No, I guess not.

L635540 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
L635539 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?

L635227 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
L635226 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?

L635212 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
L635211 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.

L635094 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ That much, huh?
L635093 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
L635092 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ They really got all that money, them whores?
L635091 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.

L635083 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...

L635077 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
L635076 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Heard you done the roof yourself.

L634981 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
L634980 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
L634979 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
L634978 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
L634977 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
L634976 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Property.
L634975 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.

L635831 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
L635830 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
L635829 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.

L635807 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
L635806 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
L635460 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
L635459 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.

L635456 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
L635455 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
L635454 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.

L635430 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
L635429 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ What?
L635428 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
L635427 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
L635426 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
L635425 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
L635424 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
L635423 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Did you... kill him?
L635422 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ "Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
L635379 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Give it to him.
L635378 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
L635372 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
L635371 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Is... is it... loaded?
L635370 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
L635368 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
L635367 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ But... if he doesn't miss?
L635366 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
L635365 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
L635341 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
L635340 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
L635339 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
L635338 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ And?
L635337 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
L635336 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
L635335 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ But he was called...
L635334 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
L635333 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ You were there?
L635332 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
L635331 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
L635330 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
L635329 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Duke.
L635328 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
L635327 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
L635326 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
L635325 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
L635323 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... Duke.
L635322 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
L635232 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
L635231 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ The... Duck of Death.
L635225 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
L635224 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ It's only a b-b-b-book...
L635220 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Letters?
L635219 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
L635218 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
L635775 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
L635774 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ N-no, sir?
L635773 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
L635772 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
L635771 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
L635770 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
L635769 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
L635768 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Then... what?
L635767 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
L635766 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ What'd Ned say?
L635765 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
L635764 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
L635763 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
L635762 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
L635761 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ A sign on him?
L635760 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
L635759 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
L635758 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
L635757 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ He hanged him?  Shot him down?
L635756 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
L635755 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Who killed him?
L635754 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
L635753 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
L635752 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
L635751 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ He's... he's dead.
L635750 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
L635749 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ Ned's share?
L635745 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
L635744 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
L635791 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
L635790 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
L635789 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
L635788 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
L635787 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
L635785 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
L635784 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
L635783 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You could have it. All of it.
L635782 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ You better get on back, Miss.
L635781 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You... gonna take... the money?
L635778 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Sure. Sure, Bill.

L635748 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
L635747 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ I trust you, Bill.
L635743 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ We all got it comin', Kid.

L635741 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
L635740 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
L635739 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Take a drink, Kid.
L635738 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
L635737 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
L635736 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
L635735 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Yeah?

L635732 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ That was... the first one.
L635731 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Yeah.

L635727 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
L635726 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.
L635723 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Just SHOOT!
L635722 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ I can't see 'em.

L635683 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ It's gonna get riper yet.
L635639 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Shut up, Kid.
L635638 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...

L635606 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I got him.
L635605 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You missed him? You didn't...?
L635604 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Better re-load it.
L635591 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ What happened, did you hit him?
L635590 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Shit!
L635585 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
L635584 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
L635583 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
L635581 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
L635580 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Did you kill him?

L635575 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Finish him, Ned.
L635360 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
L635359 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Get some sleep, Kid.
L635351 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You don't recollect!
L635350 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Well... I don't recollect.
L635349 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
L635348 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ What business?
L635347 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
L635318 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
L635317 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
L635316 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
L635297 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Lookin' at?
L635296 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
L635295 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Huh?
L635294 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
L635291 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
L635290 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You're goin' back with him?
L635289 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
L635288 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ No.
L635287 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Three ways, I figured.
L635279 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
L635278 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...

L635135 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Nor Quincy, I guess.
L635134 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.

L635131 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
L635130 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
L635129 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Well, she...
L635128 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
L635127 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
L635126 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ She gave me the evil eye.
L635125 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Sally?
L635124 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
L635123 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
L635122 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.

L635113 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ How long you gonna be, Bill?
L635111 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.

L635109 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
L635108 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ We done stuff before for money, Ned.
L635107 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
