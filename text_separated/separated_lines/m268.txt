L83267 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
L83266 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ You remember Halle.
L83265 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
L83264 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
L83263 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.

L83405 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ ..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...

Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
L83569 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Ya think?
L83568 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.

L83474 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
L83473 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ She was only-
L83472 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Leave off..

L83465 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't want to know.
L83464 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
L83463 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
L83462 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ I don't believe that. I won't.
L83461 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
L83460 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
L83459 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
L83458 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ No use thinking these things now.
L83457 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
L83456 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Never found out.
L83455 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You remember your price, Stamp?
L83446 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh yeah. I got big plans.
L83445 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You planning to do anything about it?
L83444 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Just me.
L83443 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
L83442 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
L83441 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
L83440 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ For what?
L83439 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
L83438 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
L83437 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
L83645 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ She was my best thing.
L83644 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
L83643 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ She left me. She's gone again.
L83642 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What, baby?

L83640 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
L83639 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
L83638 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
L83637 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You got to get up from here, girl.
L83636 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
