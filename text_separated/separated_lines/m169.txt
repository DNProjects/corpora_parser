L464251 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
L464250 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ What, he should see me help you catch him?
L464249 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.

L464038 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ So does it look a lot different?
L463987 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get your own room.

L463983 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
L463982 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
L463981 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ They're truck drivers.
L463980 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ They've never done a robbery?
L463978 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
L463977 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ What?
L463976 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
L463975 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No. He wants to be working for himself someday.

L463972 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
L463971 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Not without you.
L463970 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
L463969 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...

L463967 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No!
L463966 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
L463965 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I thought we'd have a few more days.
L463964 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
L463963 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
L463939 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
L463938 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Jack. Jack Bangs.
L463937 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
L463880 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Canada.
L463879 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Gabriel!
L463835 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
L463834 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...maybe I die for Nick...
L463833 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
L463832 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Nick died for me....
L463831 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
L463830 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Your pen palls dead, lady.
L463828 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I love you!
L463827 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You're in on this.
L463826 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, Nick, no --
L463825 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You told him about Nick's letters.
L463824 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, please, it's me --
L463823 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
L463822 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
L463821 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You're not hearing me here --
L463820 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He'll kill you.
L463819 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
L463818 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get the hell off of me!

L463812 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, what are you --
L463811 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
L463810 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick --
L463809 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You sold him out.
L463808 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, no --
L463807 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You motherfucker.

L463804 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
L463803 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What the fuck is going on.
L463802 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
L463800 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
L463799 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...the truck driver...
L463798 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Your brother...
L463797 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
L463766 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick...
L463765 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
L463747 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ NICK!
L463746 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ NO!
L463731 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
L463730 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'll see what I can do.
L463729 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
L463725 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
L463724 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ We could live it up and --
L463723 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ We'll have more fun in Detroit.
L463722 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
L463721 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
L463720 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
L463719 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Well, I don't know about that --
L463708 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
L463707 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Beauty and fragrances.
L463706 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You forget where I work?
L463704 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
L463703 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
L463702 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
L463701 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ash, you've gotten me enough --
L463700 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You need a COAT!
L463699 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
L463698 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
L463697 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
L463696 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ashley, Jesus --
L463693 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
L463692 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Where the hell are you going?
L463690 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Then he shoulda signed his name.
L463689 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
L463688 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
L463687 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
L463686 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Yes it was all you --
L463685 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
L463684 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
L463683 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
L463682 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
L463681 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Tell me again.
L463680 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I told you, Nick. Remember?
L463679 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
L463678 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
L463677 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
L463676 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
L463675 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
L463673 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
L463672 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, c'mon --
L463671 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ One more. Smile. One more.
L463670 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No --
L463669 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Smile.
L463668 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ What.
L463667 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Do that again.
L463666 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
L463665 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
L463664 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
L463663 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You are to me.
L463662 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
L463661 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Saw me --
L463660 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No, hey, I like your coat --
L463659 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
L463658 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No, no --
L463657 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
L463654 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Radio said.
L463653 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I don't think it's negative five.
L463652 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L463651 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Negative five?
L463650 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Radio said negative five.
L463649 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Gotta be ten degrees out there.
L464434 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ How'd you know my name.
L464433 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Ash?
L464432 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ How'd you know my name was Rudy.
L464431 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Ash?
L464420 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ How'd you know my name...
L464419 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Get in the CAR!
L464407 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
L464406 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
L464387 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
L464386 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
L464214 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
L464213 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Can't be attracting attention, right?
L464212 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ 'Tis the season, convict.
L464211 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You gotta be kidding me.
L464209 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
L464208 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
L464207 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
L464206 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
L464205 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ No gun.
L464203 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
L464202 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ No, you're not.
L464201 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm no threat without a gun.
L464200 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ No way.
L464199 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Six men means six guns.
L464198 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
L464196 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
L464195 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ No.
L464194 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
L464193 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ NO.
L464192 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You need six.
L464191 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
L464190 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
L464181 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
L464180 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ What's the code?
L464179 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
L464174 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Sing it in pictures, Nick.
L464173 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
L464172 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Start singing.
L464131 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Nick. I been trying to hit you.
L464130 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
L464127 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No, Gabriel... no...
L464126 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
L464123 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
L464122 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
L464121 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ NO!
L464120 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
L464119 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Nothing... I promise-nothing...
L464118 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
L464117 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Nnn... nothing...
L464116 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ What'd you tell that casino manager?
L464115 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...ttt..tt... two out of three?
L464114 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Got something to say to me, Nick?
L464110 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
L464109 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...never... tried...
L464108 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
L464013 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
L464012 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Don't tip.
L464011 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
L464010 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm gonna need some money.
L464009 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You got one hour.
L464007 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Get out.
L464006 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
L464005 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
L464004 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Do I get a country-western name?
L464003 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
L464002 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ At least gimme video poker.
L464001 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You do.
L464000 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
L463999 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
L463998 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Put it on.
L463997 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
L463960 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
L463959 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Might as well be.
L463958 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Rather be back in the Mountain?
L463956 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ More than you know.
L463955 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Bring back some memories, Nick?
L463953 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
L463952 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
L463951 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Trust me. They won't recognize me.
L463950 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Why not.
L463949 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ They won't recognize me.
L463946 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
L463945 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
L463944 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ So what the hell good are you...
L463941 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
L463940 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
L463933 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ And I worked there. For a year.
L463932 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ We walked the place for a week.
L463927 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
L463926 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about.
L463925 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ This isn't the Tomahawk.
L463924 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I did.
L463923 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I said, who the hell made the map?
L463922 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ What?
L463918 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?

L463772 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
L463771 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You what...
L463770 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!

L464378 +++$+++ u2597 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JACK BANGS +++$+++ ...so where is he?
L464375 +++$+++ u2597 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JACK BANGS +++$+++ I don't steal any --
L464374 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
L464373 +++$+++ u2597 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JACK BANGS +++$+++ What... Powwow...

L464350 +++$+++ u2597 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JACK BANGS +++$+++ Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
L464035 +++$+++ u2606 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ YOUNG GOVERNOR +++$+++ We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.

L464033 +++$+++ u2606 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ YOUNG GOVERNOR +++$+++ The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
L464032 +++$+++ u2597 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JACK BANGS +++$+++ Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
L464031 +++$+++ u2606 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ YOUNG GOVERNOR +++$+++ Mr. Bangs.

L464021 +++$+++ u2606 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ YOUNG GOVERNOR +++$+++ We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
L464020 +++$+++ u2597 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JACK BANGS +++$+++ There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
L464293 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
L464292 +++$+++ u2598 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JUMPY +++$+++ Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...

L464188 +++$+++ u2598 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JUMPY +++$+++ The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
L464187 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What?
L464186 +++$+++ u2598 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JUMPY +++$+++ What about the Powwow Safe?
L463943 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
L463942 +++$+++ u2598 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ JUMPY +++$+++ The Powwow Safe?

L464170 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
L464169 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
L464168 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
L464166 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
L464165 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
L464090 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
L464089 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ That motherfucker --

L464075 +++$+++ u2605 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Five years. Since it opened.
L464074 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Hell yeah. You work here long?
L464073 +++$+++ u2605 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Fuckin' freezing.
L464072 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Thanks, sister. How are ya.
L464365 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I promise you, I didn't know!
L464364 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
L464363 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Merlin, I didn't know --
L464362 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ You knew there were guns in here!
L464345 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
L464344 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
L464256 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Where the hell's Gabriel?
L464255 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
L464185 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
L464184 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ What about the money?
L464178 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ How do we do that?
L464177 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You gotta get someone upstairs.
L464176 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ How do we take them out?
L464175 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
L464062 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
L464061 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ What the hell was that about --
L463991 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Not with you.
L463990 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Having romance problems, Romeo?
L463931 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
L463930 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
L463892 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
L463891 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ You want that for here or to go?
L463734 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Hi, Nick.
L463733 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
L463605 +++$+++ u2607 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ZOOK +++$+++ THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
L463604 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fuckin, Zookerman --
L463603 +++$+++ u2607 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ZOOK +++$+++ THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
L463602 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Oh, man --
L463601 +++$+++ u2607 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ZOOK +++$+++ There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
L463600 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's a roach, guy --
L463599 +++$+++ u2607 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ZOOK +++$+++ Monsters in the gelatin...
L464458 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
L464457 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You gave them me.
L464456 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
L464455 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
L464454 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
L464453 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
L464450 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
L464449 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Do what?
L464448 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ How'd you know I'd do it.
L464447 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
L464446 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
L464445 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ And you set me up.
L464444 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
L464443 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ She set them up. All of them.
L464442 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.

L463597 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Just a roach, Zook.
L463593 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
L463592 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I don't know, I've seen the business world.
L463591 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
L463590 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What, working security?
L463589 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
L463575 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Aw, Rudy.
L463574 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
L463573 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
L463570 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
L463569 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Thought you hate your old man.

L463566 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
L463564 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Shoulda written, Rudy...
L463563 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
L463562 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
L463561 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Oh.
L463560 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
L463559 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ She's using a new perfume.
L463558 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
L463557 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
L463555 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
L463554 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
L463551 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.

L463548 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm just saying.
L463547 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why you gotta say a thing like that.
L463545 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
L463544 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
L463543 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L463542 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
L463541 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah.

L463538 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ And a slice of pecan pie, right?
L463537 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
L463536 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What?

L463531 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ain't there yet.
L463530 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
L463529 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
L463528 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hell you haven't.
L463527 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Haven't thought about it.
L463526 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
L464336 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
L464335 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ There is no other table --
L464334 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
L464333 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ I'm ninety-two years old --
L464332 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
L464331 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ What? No...
L464330 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Switch seats with me.

L464183 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
L464182 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ Without having them hit the alarms.
L463935 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ They changed the layout.
