L523828 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What do that mean?
L523827 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
L523826 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, mam...
L523825 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ And so you did your job, right?
L523824 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Nothin'...
L523823 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
L523822 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ But where is my daddy!?
L523821 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
L523820 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
L523819 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
L523818 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes mam...
L523817 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You think about your father a lot, don't you?
L523816 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
L523815 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
L523814 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
L523813 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
L523812 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You could? How?
L523811 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
L523810 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
L523809 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
L523808 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
L523807 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ ... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
L523806 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
L523805 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Well, how did you like the class, David?
L523773 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
L523772 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
L523771 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
L523770 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What about Sounder?
L523769 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
L523768 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
L523758 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
L523757 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What he talk 'bout?
L523756 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
L523755 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What's his name?
L523754 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Here's one by a man that's very much alive.

L523749 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ That's where we came from first.
L523748 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ That's where we come from first?
L523747 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Here it is, right here.
L523745 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
L523744 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
L523743 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ That's right--
L523742 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ And you say all them people is dead now?

L523735 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Miss Johnson.
L523734 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ That does it...
L523733 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Uh huh...
L523732 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
L523731 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
L523730 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
L523729 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Sometime, but not like this.
L523728 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
L523726 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Let me see it...

L523641 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
L523640 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ You would do that, wouldn't you?
L523639 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
L523638 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
L523637 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No buts, Rita!
L523636 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ I did look, Charlie, but I--
L523635 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I see you found what you was lookin' for.
L523634 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ NO! N-O, NO!
L523633 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ But, Charlie --
L523630 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
L523629 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
L523628 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
L523994 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
L523993 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ What's that, son?
L523992 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You know somethin', Daddy?
L523979 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, Daddy! Yes!
L523978 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
L523966 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
L523965 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
L523964 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
L523963 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
L523962 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
L523961 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
L523953 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ September 4 -- how far away is that?
L523952 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
L523951 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
L523950 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ From Miss Johnson --
L523930 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
L523929 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You hurt, Daddy!?
L523927 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
L523926 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
L523925 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
L523923 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Daddy...
L523922 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.

L523901 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
L523895 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
L523894 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You feel alright today, Daddy?
L523892 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Guess I can't just lay here, then.
L523891 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ They gone to the field...
L523890 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Where's everybody?
L523889 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mornin', Daddy...
L523888 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Mornin', son...
L523887 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Come here, son...
L523886 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
L523885 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Goodnight to you, son...
L523884 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Goodnight, Daddy...
L523882 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
L523881 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ You bet we is!
L523880 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
L523879 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
L523877 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
L523876 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What happened afta that?
L523875 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
L523874 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
L523873 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
L523872 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Where was you, Daddy?
L523871 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Son, that was some trip you went on...
L523861 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
L523860 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
L523580 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
L523579 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
L523578 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
L523577 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
L523573 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I think so...
L523572 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
L523571 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
L523570 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
L523569 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ He'll show up one day.
L523568 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ We didn't find Sounder yet.
L523565 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
L523564 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
L523563 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Hi to you, son...
L523562 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Hi, Daddy...
L523561 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Well, looka here...
L523385 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
L523384 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ "You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
L523383 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
L523382 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
L523381 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
L523380 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, sir...
L523379 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
L523378 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
L523377 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ You learnin' anything at that school?
L523376 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
L523375 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
L523374 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, sir...
L523373 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ David Lee...
L523372 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
L523371 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
L523370 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
L523369 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, sir...
L523365 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Yeah. We better git back to house now.
L523364 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ It was too dark, Daddy.
L523363 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
L523358 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Here, put my jacket over you.
L523357 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ It's cold, Daddy!
L523356 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
L523355 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
L523698 +++$+++ u7742 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
L523697 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
L523696 +++$+++ u7742 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Sunday...
L523695 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ When's that?
L523694 +++$+++ u7742 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
L523693 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mister, can you visit anybody here?
L523559 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Nathan Lee Morgan...
L523558 +++$+++ u7742 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ What's your daddy's name?
L523622 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, ma'am...?
L523621 +++$+++ u7746 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ David!
L523620 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
L523618 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
L523617 +++$+++ u7746 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Yes, David...
L523616 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Miss Boatwright --
L523613 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ My father taught me...
L523612 +++$+++ u7746 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
L523984 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Josie Mae.
L523983 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Naw, I'm carryin' it!
L523611 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
L523610 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
L523607 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Act like one!
L523606 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't look like no possum!
L523605 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
L523604 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Then why don't he holler like he usta?
L523603 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
L523402 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Sausage and hambones!
L523401 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What's in there, David!?
L523988 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, ma'm...
L523987 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Be good and be smart, little boy.
L523933 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He can't get up, Mama!
L523932 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What's wrong, Nathan?
L523856 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
L523855 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
L523854 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ It's the heat.
L523853 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What's wrong with him, David?
L523847 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
L523846 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
L523845 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
L523844 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
L523843 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
L523842 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ So when I left, she gave me these books.
L523841 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
L523840 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Who's Miss Johnson?
L523839 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
L523838 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What's that you carryin'?
L523837 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
L523836 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
L523835 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Did you find your father?
L523834 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
L523687 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
L523686 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, mam...
L523685 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
L523684 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
L523683 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
L523680 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Good night...
L523679 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Good night, Mama...
L523678 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
L523677 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Can I go day after tomorrow?
L523676 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
L523675 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
L523674 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
L523673 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
L523672 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
L523671 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
L523670 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Can't sleep?
L523627 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
L523626 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
L523602 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
L523601 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Poor creature...
L523598 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Listen, Mama...
L523597 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What is it, David Lee?
L523542 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
L523541 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ No mam -- I looked all over.
L523540 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Any sign of Sounder?
L523539 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You sure can, son...
L523538 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Can I go when the holiday comes?
L523537 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
L523536 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Did you see Daddy?
L523503 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ 'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
L523502 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ 'Bye, Mama...
L523493 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ David, come back here!
L523492 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
L523479 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Children, come here...
L523478 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Who is they?
L523464 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Same as we -- they pray.
L523463 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
L523460 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
L523459 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Who's winning, Mama?
L523430 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
L523429 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes mam...
L523428 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You got two shirts on?
L523427 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
L523426 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Ready to go, Mama!
L523409 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
L523408 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Where did it come from, Mama?
L523407 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That's right!
L523406 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
L523387 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Goodnight.
L523386 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
L523655 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
L523654 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Hello, David...
L523652 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I'm used to it.
L523651 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
L523650 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I'll walk...
L523649 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Come, I'll take you home.
L523648 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
L523647 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ But, Miss Boatwright, you--
L523646 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
L523645 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
L523644 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
L523643 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
L523625 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
L523624 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
L523623 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
L523615 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
L523614 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
L523452 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
L523451 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
L523450 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ When you read it we'll talk about it...
L523449 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
L523448 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ It's about the Three Musketeers.
L523445 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
L523444 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
L523441 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Come in, children.
L523440 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
L523948 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
L523947 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Well, let me have it.
L523946 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
L523945 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Whatcha got there?
L523944 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
L523943 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
L523469 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
L523468 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
L523467 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
L523466 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ They probly thought you was crazy.
L523465 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
L523462 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
L523461 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
L523661 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
L523660 +++$+++ u7744 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ JOSIE MAE +++$+++ Mama, what was we laughin' for?
L523498 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Might be...
L523497 +++$+++ u7744 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ JOSIE MAE +++$+++ Is he gon' be gone long?
L523496 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
L523495 +++$+++ u7744 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ JOSIE MAE +++$+++ Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
L523424 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Maybe soon--
L523423 +++$+++ u7744 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ JOSIE MAE +++$+++ Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
L523422 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
L523912 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
L523911 +++$+++ u7745 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MR HOWARD +++$+++ Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
L523910 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Tired.

L523398 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
L523397 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
L523395 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
L523394 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
L523393 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
L523392 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
L523389 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
L523388 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Night, son!
L523595 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Is that a blessing, Reverend?
L523594 +++$+++ u7749 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ PREACHER +++$+++ It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
L523593 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
L523592 +++$+++ u7749 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ PREACHER +++$+++ I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
L523591 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
L523590 +++$+++ u7749 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ PREACHER +++$+++ No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
L523515 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
L523514 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
L523513 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Will they give him a trial?
L523512 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
L523511 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
L523510 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
L523509 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
L523508 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
L523507 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
L523506 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
L523505 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I wanta see Nathan.
L523504 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
