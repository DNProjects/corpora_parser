L374314 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
L374210 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.

L374000 +++$+++ u6529 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ BOY #1 +++$+++ No.
L373997 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
L373996 +++$+++ u6529 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ BOY #1 +++$+++ Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
L373993 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
L373992 +++$+++ u6529 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ BOY #1 +++$+++ We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
L374005 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.

L373998 +++$+++ u6530 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ BOY #2 +++$+++ Well, we want good stuff.
L373995 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...

L373989 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
L374018 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
L374017 +++$+++ u6531 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ BOYS +++$+++ Uh...can we give you a check?
L374016 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
L374015 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.

L374013 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I gotta get the stuff.

L374379 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
L374378 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
L374377 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
L374376 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Panther!  Same thing...
L374375 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Panther...
L374373 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Thanks for the ride.
L374372 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
L374371 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'll say that I'm travelling.
L374370 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ And say what?
L374369 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
L374368 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ How about Teresa?  I could talk...
L374367 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
L374366 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
L374365 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, come on...
L374364 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No.
L374363 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ You flew before?
L374362 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L374361 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Nervous?
L374360 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
L374359 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ So?
L374358 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
L374357 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
L374356 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Kennedy.
L374355 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Where to?
L374338 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
L374337 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
L374336 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Get out of here before this really goes up.
L374304 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
L374303 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ She don't look Jewish.
L374302 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Look at her.
L374301 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How do you know?
L374300 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Jewish...
L374299 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who's the girl?
L374054 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
L374053 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
L374051 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
L374050 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ 'Thou art then a king?'
L374049 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
L374047 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
L374046 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ 'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
L374045 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Salute!!!
L374044 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ 'And with your spirit.'
L374043 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ May God be with you.
L373766 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Anybody wanna have a game?
L373765 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ No.
L373755 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
L373754 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
L373753 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
L373746 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ 'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
L373745 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
L373742 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Be careful.
L373741 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
L373740 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
L373739 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
L374200 +++$+++ u6535 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
L374199 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You got some mouth!
L374165 +++$+++ u6535 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
L374164 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
L374163 +++$+++ u6535 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
L374162 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Next time, bet with your own kind.
L373761 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not quite...but keep trying.
L373760 +++$+++ u6535 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Waddaya think?
L374344 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Good idea.
L374343 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ What are you going to do?  Hide me?
L374342 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Forget it.
L374341 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
L374340 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No.
L374339 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I think we should see your uncle.
L374324 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
L374323 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
L374296 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Mind your own business.
L374295 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Back so soon.
L374289 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I'll be here.  Don't worry.
L374288 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't you move!!!
L374285 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Come on.
L374284 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
L374283 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
L374282 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
L374281 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, cut it out, will ya?
L374280 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ No you're not...
L374279 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
L374274 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
L374273 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
L374262 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
L374261 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
L374257 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
L374256 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't be smart.
L374255 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
L374254 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
L374253 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
L374251 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
L374250 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Shut up!
L374184 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ You tell me that in front of these creeps?
L374183 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Keep your mouth shut.
L374099 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I understand.
L374098 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
L374097 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
L374096 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
L374095 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
L374094 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
L374093 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How?
L374092 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
L374091 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
L374090 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
L374089 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
L374088 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
L374087 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's not going to help.
L374086 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
L374085 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Did you see them run!
L374084 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L374081 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
L374080 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
L374077 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
L374076 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Don't come any closer!!!
L373829 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
L373828 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I could have told you that.
L373827 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Hey...you got nothing here.
L373825 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Listen...I'm a guest here.
L373824 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
L373823 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
L373822 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't promise...just deliver.
L373821 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
L373820 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
L373819 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
L373818 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
L373817 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I don't like loading crates.
L373816 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
L373815 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Didn't show up.
L373814 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L373813 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ There won't be any this week.
L373812 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
L373811 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Don't worry.  I can handle it.
L373810 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
L373809 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Wouldn't bother me.
L373808 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
L373805 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, she isn't.
L373804 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
L373775 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Should I slap him?
L373774 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
L373764 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
L373763 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Nah.
L373731 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
L373730 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ It's the truth, I swear.
L373712 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
L373711 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I know but let's hear it anyway.
L373710 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
L373709 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What happened to you Flash?
L373698 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Giovanino!  Where have you been?
L373697 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Drinks for everybody Tony...
L373889 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ What can I say?
L373888 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
L373887 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
L373886 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't understand, where's Groppi?
L373885 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
L373884 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
L373883 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
L373882 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
L373881 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
L373880 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That bad, huh?
L373879 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
L373878 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
L373877 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What pipes?
L373876 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
L373875 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No.
L373874 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
L373873 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ok, how's everything going?
L373872 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
L374332 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
L374331 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're really crazy.
L374327 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, where's the rest?
L374326 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Where's the rest?
L374240 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Whatever.
L374239 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
L374234 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We'll be here.
L374233 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
L374068 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You said it.
L374067 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
L374066 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
L374065 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
L374064 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
L374063 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
L374062 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Charlie, this is business.
L374061 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ $3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
L374060 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ $500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
L374059 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How much was the original loan again?
L374058 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
L374057 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
L374056 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
L374032 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let's go to the movies...on you.
L374031 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ $20.
L374030 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How much?
L374029 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
L374028 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What's a'matter?
L373982 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We'll settle it tonight.
L373981 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
L373980 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
L373979 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
L373978 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh Michael, look...
L373801 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
L373800 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You getting out too?
L373799 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ C'mon Johnny.
L373798 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Out!!!!
L373797 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ok...that's it.
L373796 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Disgraceful.
L373792 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Get him in.
L373791 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey, shut up.
L373769 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ OK, get in.
L373768 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Michael, give us a lift.
L373695 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ OK.
L373694 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
L373693 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
L373692 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
L373691 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
L373690 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
L373689 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
L373688 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
L373687 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
L373686 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
L373685 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nope...
L373684 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
L373683 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No...I'll be ok for a week.
L373682 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
L373681 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ OK, ok...
L373680 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
L373679 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh great...hey - Winstons?
L374232 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Bye.
L374231 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
L374230 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
L374229 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Chinese food?
L374228 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
L374227 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Hostess?
L374226 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No...no stripping...as the hostess.
L374225 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Stripper?
L374224 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
L374223 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ That's nice.
L374222 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
L374221 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I know.
L374220 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, I'm serious...You're really good.
L374219 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Fine.
L374218 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
L374217 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Fine.
L374216 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Diane, how are you feeling?
L374152 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
L374151 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Well, maybe you missed something?
L374148 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ All right.
L374147 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
L374146 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do they expect you to say?
L374145 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
L374144 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
L374143 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, she's got epilepsy.
L374142 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ ...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
L374141 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Teresa.
L374140 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
L374135 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What did he do?
L374134 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ ...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
L374129 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
L374128 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh yes, he's pretty good.
L374116 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
L374115 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
L374114 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
L374113 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
L373968 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
L373967 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
L373966 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
L373965 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh...around...why?
L373964 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Hey, where you been?
L373963 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ok.
L373962 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Take a drink!
L373913 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
L373912 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
L373911 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Yes, you did.
L373910 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
L373909 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ No you weren't.
L373908 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ About that shooting last night...I was there and...
L373907 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
L373906 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Uncle, how are you feeling?
L374150 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
L374149 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
L374131 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
L374130 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
L374124 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
L374123 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ "Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
L374122 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ Wha?
L374121 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ "Francis Macomber."
L374120 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
L374119 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nothing.
L374118 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ What was it?
L374117 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wasn't a book...was a short story.
L374242 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
L374241 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
L374214 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ But...
L374213 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
L374212 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
L374211 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
L374073 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
L374072 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
L373947 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ The green capsules in the top drawer.
L373946 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
L373945 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I'm sleepy.
L373944 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
L373943 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
L373942 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
L373938 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I know...I know.
L373937 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I can take care of myself.  You know that.
L373936 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well you can't blame them in a way.
L373935 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ You know why...with my parents.
L373934 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
L373933 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
L373931 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Watch your language.
L373930 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ You're intolerable today.
L373929 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That W.A.S.P. bastard.
L373928 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
L373927 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Sure...He lives there?
L373926 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
L373924 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's the word...preoccupied.
L373923 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
L373922 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Take your time.  I don't care.
L373921 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
L373920 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
L373919 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ A paper on that one too?
L373918 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Bore.
L373917 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Ok.
L373916 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
L373915 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
L373862 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
L373861 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ It's still sick.
L373860 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
L373859 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
L373858 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
L373857 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ No.
L373856 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Did you?
L373855 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
L373854 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't ask.
L373853 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ What is it now?
L373852 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
L373851 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Anything specific?
L373850 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
L373849 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nobody knows anything, believe me.
L373848 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Charlie...?
L373847 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Maybe, who knows.
L373846 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
L373845 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
L373844 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ It's all right.
L373843 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sure...it's not that...I mean...
L373842 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I don't mind.
L373841 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well...
L373840 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Please take it.
L373839 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Here.
L373838 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
L373837 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Do you have enough?
L373836 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ok, we'll go for lunch.
L373835 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
L374196 +++$+++ u6536 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
L374195 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Count it.
L374194 +++$+++ u6536 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Don't count it...it's all there.
L374182 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
L374181 +++$+++ u6536 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What's the matter with this kid?
L374180 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
L374179 +++$+++ u6536 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ The girls like it loud.
L374178 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
L374174 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++  Shut up.
L374173 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Scumbag--
L373757 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
L373756 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
L373702 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Yeah, so things'll be even.
L373701 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
