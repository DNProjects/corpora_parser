L390621 +++$+++ u2113 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
L390620 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.

L390472 +++$+++ u2113 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Most we've ever used is half a CC.

L390225 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
L390224 +++$+++ u2113 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Monkeybone?
L390223 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.

L390201 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I didn't say anything.

L390198 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
L390196 +++$+++ u2114 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ BULL +++$+++ Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.

L390745 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
L390744 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Back? You're sending me back?
L390743 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.

L390740 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
L390739 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
L390738 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ DEATH!!
L390670 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Bend over?
L390669 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ <i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
L390668 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
L390667 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
L390666 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ Well - you'd need a body.
L390665 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
L390664 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
L390663 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
L390662 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ <u>Why</u>??
L390661 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
L390660 +++$+++ u2115 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DEATH +++$+++ Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
L390659 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
L390250 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
L390249 +++$+++ u2116 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DR. EDELSTEIN +++$+++ Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
L390244 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
L390243 +++$+++ u2116 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DR. EDELSTEIN +++$+++ Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
L390242 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
L390241 +++$+++ u2116 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DR. EDELSTEIN +++$+++ At the moment, yes.
L390240 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
L390239 +++$+++ u2116 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DR. EDELSTEIN +++$+++ He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
L390238 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
L390237 +++$+++ u2116 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ DR. EDELSTEIN +++$+++ Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
L390648 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
L390647 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
L390646 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
L390645 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ You're really gonna pop the question?
L390607 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
L390606 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
L390605 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
L390604 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ How much?
L390603 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
L390602 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Less.
L390601 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
L390600 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ What's the matter?
L390614 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ A piñata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
L390613 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
L390150 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ ...In some weird way I respect that.
L390149 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
L390148 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Oh my God...you're proposing?
L390147 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
L390146 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Why?
L390145 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
L390144 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
L390143 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
L390142 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
L390141 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
L390140 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
L390139 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
L390138 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
L390137 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
L390136 +++$+++ u2117 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HERB +++$+++ Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
L390651 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
L390650 +++$+++ u2118 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HUTCH +++$+++ The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
L390432 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What'll it do if they pull the plug?
L390431 +++$+++ u2118 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HUTCH +++$+++ You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
L390429 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
L390428 +++$+++ u2118 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HUTCH +++$+++ That's not going to stop his nightmare -
L390427 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
L390424 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
L390423 +++$+++ u2118 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HUTCH +++$+++ Holy shit.
L390524 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
L390523 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
L390522 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
L390521 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Monkeybone...!?
L390520 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
L390519 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
L390518 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
L390517 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
L390516 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
L390515 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ YOU SET ME UP!!
L390514 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
L390485 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
L390484 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
L390397 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
L390396 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Land of Death. How do I get there?
L390393 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Hyp, I'll do anything.
L390392 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
L390391 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
L390388 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
L390387 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
L390386 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
L390385 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
L390384 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Maybe you could talk to Death!
L390383 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
L390380 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
L390379 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
L390378 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
L390374 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
L390373 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
L390371 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
L390370 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
L390369 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Tell me what?
L390368 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
L390366 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
L390365 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Uh huh. And?
L390364 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
L390363 +++$+++ u2119 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ HYPNOS +++$+++ Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
L390702 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ He called me "Doc."
L390701 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
L390698 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
L390697 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
L390696 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
L390695 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It looks so...<u>new</u>.
L390694 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
L390598 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ <u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
L390597 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
L390596 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
L390595 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
L390594 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
L390593 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
L390582 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
L390581 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
L390574 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
L390573 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
L390571 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ I need a new PR guy.
L390570 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
L390569 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
L390568 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
L390567 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
L390546 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
L390545 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Got a doctor on duty.
L390544 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You sure this is...medically advisable?
L390543 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Ohhh, nothing.
L390542 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What are you watching?
L390538 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ <i></i> In what way?
L390537 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're acting kind of...odd.
L390536 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Sure. Why?
L390535 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Stu, are you...feeling okay?
L390534 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Bitchin' good cake.
L390532 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
L390531 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
L390530 +++$+++ u2125 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU-BONE +++$+++ Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
L390529 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
L390758 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ My <u>tail</u> itches.
L390757 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L390756 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
L390755 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
L390550 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
L390549 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ How was it? I don't recall.
L390490 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
L390489 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Stu?
L390171 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I'd better go report this...
L390170 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
L390166 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Are you okay??
L390165 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L390164 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
L390162 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
L390161 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
L390160 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I might wake up.
L390159 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What's the "bad" part?
L390158 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
L390157 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
L390156 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
L390155 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Who?
L390154 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Look at this! He won't let us leave!
L390135 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
L390134 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Can't you give it to me later?
L390133 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
L390132 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
L390131 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
L390130 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
L390322 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.

L390248 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ Give me a date, Doctor.
L390247 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
L390246 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
L390245 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
L390235 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -

L390233 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
L390232 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
L390231 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?

L390632 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Don't ask where I got it.
L390563 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
L390562 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
L390561 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
L390560 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
L390276 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.

L390272 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.

L390479 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
L390478 +++$+++ u2123 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ MONKEYBONE +++$+++ Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
L390477 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
L390476 +++$+++ u2123 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ MONKEYBONE +++$+++ Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
