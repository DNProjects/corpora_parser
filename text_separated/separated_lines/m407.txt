L326445 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ How about any guys on your staff?
L326444 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Only me and Mom ..
L326443 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
L326442 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
L326441 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Is it your vehicle?
L326440 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ The van?
L326439 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
L326438 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
L326274 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
L326273 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You ain't going in alone?
L326272 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
L326271 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
L326270 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What if we need a back up?
L326269 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ <u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
L326268 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
L326267 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What d'you mean, "bits."
L326266 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Bits.
L326265 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
L326264 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ It's twenty of three.
L326263 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I guess by the bed.
L326262 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Where's your watch?
L326261 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Hey ..
L326260 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Listen, you don't havta come?
L326258 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
L326257 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Now?
L326256 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm going up to the institute.
L326255 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What exactly you doing, John?
L326253 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
L326252 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Jesus. What are you doin?
L326235 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's just what I wanna find out.
L326234 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
L326233 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You got a quiet phone somewhere?
L326228 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Are you sure you didn't call?
L326227 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
L326209 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
L326208 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
L326198 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
L326197 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What about Citrine?
L326196 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
L326195 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I dunno what I can do to help you?
L326194 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
L326193 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
L326192 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ <u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
L326191 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Ease off, John ..
L326190 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
L326189 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I'm asking it.
L326188 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's a very stupid question, Ross.
L326186 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No .. You didn't know that ..
L326185 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Well .. I didn't know that ..
L326184 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ <u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
L326183 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You don't really believe this?
L326182 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
L326181 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
L326180 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
L326141 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
L326140 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
L326139 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Sure.
L326138 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
L326137 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ She wasn't lying about the van.
L326136 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
L326135 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Just makes to so God damned mad ..
L326134 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
L326133 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
L326132 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
L326131 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Stop it.
L326120 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
L326119 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ God, it pisses me off, Ross.
L326086 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Car accident.
L326085 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Why's she blind, Bro?
L326054 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
L326053 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
L326052 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You looked like you did?
L326051 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did I say he did?
L326050 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
L326049 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
L326048 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
L326047 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did he shut you down?
L325988 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
L325987 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You believe me, don't you?
L325985 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I was wrong.
L325984 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ That isn't what you said before.
L325983 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
L325982 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
L325981 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
L325980 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Listen to me saying what?
L325979 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
L325978 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
L325977 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
L325976 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
L325975 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
L325969 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You want me to stop the car?
L325968 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
L325967 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
L325966 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
L325965 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ To throw out of the window.
L325964 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What do you want it for?
L325963 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
L325962 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
L325961 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
L325960 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Why?
L325959 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Then give me that Zippo.
L325958 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I haven't got it.
L325957 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Pay me, and I shut up.
L325956 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
L325955 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ So am I. But where's my money?
L325954 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
L325953 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
L325952 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We're going.
L325951 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
L325950 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
L325949 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No, you didn't.
L325948 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
L325926 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ <u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
L325925 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
L325924 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Thank Christ we got a witness.
L325923 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
L325911 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
L325910 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Where is everyone?
L325894 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
L325893 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
L325890 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
L325889 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
L325888 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Because I dislike her too much ..
L325887 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
L325886 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
L325885 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What do you mean, Ross?
L325884 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
L325883 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L325852 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
L325851 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Someone bet me a dollar ..
L325850 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ How'd you do it, old man?
L325849 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
L325848 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
L325847 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You gotta stop smoking ..
L325843 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
L325842 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Maybe?
L325841 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You want my advice?
L325840 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
L325839 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
L325838 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
L325836 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ It's a method for quitting smoking.
L325835 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
L325834 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I already did. What's his problem?
L325833 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
L325831 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
L325830 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ There's nothing in the files?
L325829 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Because, don't get into it ...
L325828 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
L325827 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
L325826 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What time is it?
L325816 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John.
L325815 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Not too good in daylight ..
L325814 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What does that mean?
L325813 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ O.K.
L325812 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ How's the new residence?
L325810 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Since when did you drink diet soda?
L325809 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
L325806 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
L325805 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Not for me ..
L325802 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
L325801 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Who is who?
L325762 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
L325761 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Yeah, he can go ...
L325755 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
L325754 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ The <u>dogs</u>?
L325753 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
L325751 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I think you're here all day.
L325750 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What do you think?
L325745 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
L325744 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What about that kid, Ross?
L325743 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
L325742 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
L325731 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
L325730 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
L325727 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ "Welcome to Eureka."
L325726 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
L325725 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You heard. Look for the knife.
L325724 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
L325717 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
L325716 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Be my guest. What you got?
L325715 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I hope I'm not intruding?
L325714 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did you bring it with you?
L326462 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
L326461 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
L326460 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
L326312 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
L326311 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
L326310 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
L326117 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No.
L326116 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ And did they?
L326115 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
L326114 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
L326113 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's bullshit,
L326112 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
L326111 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Once.
L326110 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I'm talking, outside the girl?
L326109 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Three or four.
L326108 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
L326107 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
L326106 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
L326046 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
L326045 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
L326044 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
L326043 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
L326042 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
L326041 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
L326040 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
L326039 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No, Sir.
L326038 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Have you got a print from the hand?
L326037 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No.
L326036 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Have you got a match on the bullet?
L326035 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
L326034 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
L326033 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
L326032 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
L325877 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
L325876 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What do you want me to do, Chief?
L325875 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
L325874 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I thought it was Taylor's case?
L325873 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
L325869 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
L325868 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
L325867 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I don't see that at all ..
L325866 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
L325865 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ What is all this Jennifer stuff?
L325864 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
L325863 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ How do you know her hair's black?
L325862 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
L325861 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ What is that?
L325788 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
L325787 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Why did he ask if it was frozen?
L325778 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Maybe he's lying to you?
L325777 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Kid told me he didn't take it?
L325776 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No .. But we have a theory ..
L325775 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
L325772 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
L325771 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
L325770 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Did he get you the job?
L325767 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
L325766 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Is this normal?
L325741 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
L325740 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
L325739 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
L325733 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
L325732 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ What does that mean, Sergeant?
L325729 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
L325728 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
L326425 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
L326424 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I've heard you call him Freddy.
L326423 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
L326413 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He ain't offerin me shit.
L326412 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
L326178 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
L326177 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I know what a "witness" is.
L326176 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ <u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
L326175 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You don't know what you done, Taylor.
L326169 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
L326168 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
L326167 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
L326166 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Bullshit.
L326165 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
L326164 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
L326163 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
L326162 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
L326161 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ <u>You</u> put it in there.
L326160 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
L326145 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Wrong cabinet.
L326144 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Vehicle references.
L326143 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What are you looking for?
L326142 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ .. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
L326130 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
L326129 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
L325909 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
L325908 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
L325907 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
L325906 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
L325899 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
L325898 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
L325897 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
L325896 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
L325895 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
L326421 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
L326420 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I don't want them to arrest you.
L326419 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I think they're gonna arrest me.
L326418 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I wanna be near you ...
L326417 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
L326408 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I'm blind because my father drank.
L326407 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You do?
L326406 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I know about alcohol, John.
L326405 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He doesn't need my help.
L326397 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Then why didn't he kill me?
L326396 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He don't know that. I didn't.
L326395 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I can't identify him ..
L326394 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Coz he thinks you're a witness.
L326393 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Why does he want to kill me?
L326392 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
L326391 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ <u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
L326390 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
L326389 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
L326294 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No .. not now ..
L326293 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I'm going back to the institute.
L326292 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
L326287 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
L326286 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Why?
L326285 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ It's not possible right now.
L326284 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Why can't I stay with you?
L326205 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
L326204 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
L326203 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ No I'm not.
L326202 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You're looking worried again, Helena?
L326201 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
L326200 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
L326199 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Has he got your aunt's address?
L326150 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
L326149 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You know? How do you know?
L326148 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I know.
L326147 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I have to talk to you, Helena.
L326102 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
L326101 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Which is what?
L326100 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Just your age.
L326099 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He said that? What else did he say?
L326098 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
L326097 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Really? What did he say?
L326096 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Ross told me.
L326095 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ How d'you know what I'm like?
L326094 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I know what you're like ..
L326093 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I was married to her sister ..
L326092 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Have you known her long?

L326024 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.

L326020 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?

L326018 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
L326017 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ "Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
L326016 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
L326015 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ You just asked me to ask you questions.
L326014 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
L326013 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Are you married?
L326012 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
L326011 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
L326010 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.

L326005 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ You should. It's wonderful.

L326002 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What are you reading?
L326001 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ It was probably the wind.
L326000 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
L325998 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Of course I would ..
L325997 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
L325996 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
L325995 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
L325994 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
L325992 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
L325991 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
L325990 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
L325989 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Have you been here long?
L325944 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I don't know.
L325943 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What color was it?
L325942 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Yes.
L325941 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Did Amber have a dog?
L325939 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
L325938 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
L325937 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ No.
L325936 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
L325935 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
L325934 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Me?
L325933 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ No. Except he smoked. Like you.
L325932 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
L325931 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ My hands?
L325930 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Can I see your hands?
L325929 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ No, it has a mind of its own.
L325928 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ The elevator wasn't working?
L325922 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
L325921 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
L325920 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Why not? You heard my voice?
L325919 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No.
L325918 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
L325917 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You must have some idea about him.
L325915 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
L325914 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
L325913 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
L325912 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
L326308 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ The man from the F.B.I.
L326307 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Who sought the warrant?
L326306 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
L326305 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You got a warrant for this?
L326304 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
L326303 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Why?
L326302 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I been told to take your car in, Sir.
L326301 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What are you doing, Travis?
L325786 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
L325785 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
L325784 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
L325783 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Grateful for your candor, Sir.
L325782 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ .. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
L325781 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
L325780 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Interview over, Blattis ...
L325905 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
L325904 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
L325903 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
L325902 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Yeah, I guess I do.
L325901 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ You find something curious in that?
L325900 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
L326289 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
L326288 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Is that Margie?
L326237 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Don't mix very well with beer.
L326236 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ How you doing on those shoes?
L326222 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
L326221 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ You think John would like it?
L326220 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
L326219 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
L326218 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
L326217 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ You think he still loves her?
L326216 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
L326215 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ What does that mean?
L326214 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
L326213 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ What was she like?
L326212 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Two or three years ago.
L326211 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ When did John divorce?
L326083 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
L326082 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ He's not that bad of a guy ..?
L326081 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ She married some English prick.
L326077 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
L326076 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You want something, darling?
L326075 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
L326074 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
L326073 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
L326072 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ He's happy, darlin ..
L326071 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
L326070 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
L325808 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Even better.
L325807 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
L325804 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
L325803 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ So tonight she confesses?
L325800 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Freddy's new obsession ..
L325799 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
L325798 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
L325797 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
L325796 +++$+++ u6126 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
L326174 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
L326173 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Shut up, King Jay ..
L326172 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
L326171 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
L326170 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
L326159 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Whass going on here?
L326158 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
L326127 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
L326126 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
L325760 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Ask him.
L325759 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
L325748 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I think I've found a hand.
L325747 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
L325746 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
L325722 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ No, Sir.
L325721 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Don't annoy me, Travis.
L325720 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
L325711 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
L325710 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Where do you fit in, Trimble?
L325706 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ A derelict.
L325705 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
L325704 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
L325703 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ He has? .. What's he doing here?
L325702 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
L325701 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I'm already walking. Where is it?
L325700 +++$+++ u6129 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ You can drive down there, Sir ..
