L565093 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I hope she gets better.
L565092 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I will.
L565091 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Say hi to Zoe.
L565090 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Alison.
L565089 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Alison.
L565088 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
L565087 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
L564735 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
L564734 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ What happened?
L564729 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
L564728 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ What happened?
L564727 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
L564726 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I...don't think so.
L564617 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ That's okay.
L564616 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm...so sorry.
L564615 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It turns to steaming piss.
L564614 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ What...does it turn to?
L564555 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
L564554 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ She's in trouble?
L564553 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's where I'm going.  To see her.
L564552 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ But you said...
L564551 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ She didn't.
L564550 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Then...when did she get better?
L564549 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
L564548 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ So there were others?
L564547 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
L564546 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
L564545 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Which clinic?
L564544 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Which one?
L564543 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Which one?
L564542 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
L564541 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Are you still in touch?
L564540 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
L564495 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
L564494 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes...fine.
L564493 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I'd heard that.  But she's well?
L564492 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ We're...not together.
L564491 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ How is Mrs. Stephens?
L564490 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Ally Jones.
L564489 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
L564488 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ And what does he do again?
L564487 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
L564486 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
L564485 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ How are you?
L564484 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Ally.  That's right.
L564483 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Ally.  That was my nickname.
L564482 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564481 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Alison Jones.
L564480 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
L564864 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
L564863 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why are you telling me this?
L564862 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
L564771 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
L564770 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why are you telling me this?
L564769 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
L564767 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
L564766 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
L564765 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Case?
L564764 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
L564763 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
L564762 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
L564761 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
L564759 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Not unless you can raise the dead.
L564758 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I can help you.
L564757 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ No you don't.
L564756 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I understand.
L564755 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Mister, I don't want to know your name.
L564754 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ My name is...
L564682 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Goodnight, Nicole.
L564681 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
L564680 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Oh.  Right.
L564679 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L564678 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
L564677 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
L564676 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
L564675 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
L564674 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I don't know.
L564673 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why?
L564672 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ It just seems...kind of weird.
L564671 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L564670 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Are you sure?
L564623 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Okay.
L564622 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'll be back around nine.
L564621 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Was it good?
L564620 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ They just finished supper.
L564619 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
L564618 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Hi, Nicole.
L564995 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Say hello for me.
L564994 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She's resting.  In her room.
L564993 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ How is Nicole?  Is she around?
L564992 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ The children.
L564991 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Billy, please.  The children.
L564990 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
L564977 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
L564976 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
L564989 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L564988 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
L564987 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
L564986 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
L564985 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
L564982 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
L564981 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ C'mon, you know that won't...
L564980 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
L564979 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
L564978 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
L564975 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
L564974 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
L564973 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
L564972 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
L564971 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
L564970 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Because it's what we have to do.
L564969 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why not?
L564968 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
L564967 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ How?
L564966 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
L564965 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It does concern me.
L564964 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
L564963 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
L564962 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So what brings you out tonight?
L564751 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
L564750 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Why did you do that, Billy?
L564749 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Yes.
L564748 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
L564747 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well I don't.
L564746 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Because I have to.
L564745 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why?
L564744 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ I have to.
L564743 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You believe that?
L564742 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
L564741 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
L564740 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
L564739 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
L564738 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
L564669 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Good night.
L564668 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Good night, Billy.
L564667 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I better get back.
L564666 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ You're leaving.
L564665 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Just like we look forward to this.
L564664 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Sure.
L564663 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ They can look forward to that.
L564662 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
L564661 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Your kids never cry.
L564660 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It's natural.
L564659 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Yes.
L564658 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ That's because he misses you.
L564657 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
L564656 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What are you thinking?
L564631 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ When the game's over, I guess.
L564630 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What time's he coming home?
L564629 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ No.  It should be dry by now.
L564628 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Does this mean I can't take a shower?
L564626 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
L564625 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ A while.
L564624 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Have you been waiting long?
L564538 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Can't you make it later?
L564537 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ She said she's got to be home by nine.
L564536 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Billy, that's too early.
L564535 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
L564930 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
L564929 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Why would he be frightened?
L564928 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
L564799 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
L564798 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's what he said, is it?
L564796 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
L564795 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Anything you didn't understand?
L564794 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564793 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ You heard what Abbott said?
L564790 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
L564789 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Excuse me?
L564788 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ What other people?
L564787 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
L564785 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
L564784 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
L564783 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I did.
L564782 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ You've talked to Billy?
L564781 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Billy said that?
L564780 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  He does.
L564779 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ He knows that?  Billy?
L564778 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
L564777 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Because I'd be to blame, right?
L564776 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That would complicate things.
L564775 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
L564774 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What's that, Dolores?
L564773 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
L564713 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
L564712 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Did they give him special care?
L564711 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ What do you mean?
L564710 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Did his parents attend to that?
L564709 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ That's right.
L564708 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
L564707 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ What do you mean?
L564706 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Were his parents...attentive to him?
L564705 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
L564702 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ With our hands.
L564701 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ And what's that?
L564700 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
L564699 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Berry-picking.
L564698 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
L564697 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
L564696 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Berries.
L564695 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
L564532 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ No.  I saw it on his face.
L564531 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You talked about it?
L564530 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
L564529 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
L564528 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ From what?
L564527 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ From what?
L564526 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
L564522 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ 
L564521 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ For rabbits?
L564520 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
L564519 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
L564518 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ And they loved Bear.
L564517 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
L564516 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Do they have any reputation for drugs?
L564515 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
L564514 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
L564513 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ About the Ottos?
L564512 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What do you mean by that, Dolores?
L564511 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
L564509 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
L564508 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Away from your crazy Mom.
L564507 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
L564506 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ It's for the school bazaar.
L564505 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I'll just strap it on the roof.
L564504 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
L564503 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I didn't say that.
L564502 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You hate it.
L564501 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
L564500 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ What do you think?
L564499 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Hi, Dolores.
L564498 +++$+++ u8041 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
L564605 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'll...take it straight.
L564604 +++$+++ u8042 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ HARTLEY +++$+++ We've only got honey.
L564603 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No.  A little sugar though.
L564602 +++$+++ u8042 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ HARTLEY +++$+++ I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
L564593 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
L564592 +++$+++ u8042 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ HARTLEY +++$+++ But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
L564580 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
L564579 +++$+++ u8042 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ HARTLEY +++$+++ You want a cup of tea or something?
L564904 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ It's the truth.
L564903 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Nicole!
L564846 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  What's this lawyer business?
L564845 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
L564840 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Who's Mr. Stephens?
L564839 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
L564838 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ From you?
L564837 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes.  It's a present.
L564836 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Is this mine?
L564835 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I feel like a princess.
L564834 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
L564833 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ It's interesting.
L564832 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ So do you like your new room?
L564813 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
L564812 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ How was it?
L564811 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well, winter's far behind us now.
L564810 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ And winter?
L564809 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Summer's over.  It's fall.
L564808 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What happened to summer?
L564807 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Isn't it a lovely day?
L564806 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
L564960 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
L564959 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
L564950 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's what he said.
L564949 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Is he coming over now?  Right away?
L564946 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
L564945 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
L564944 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No.
L564943 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Did he say what about?
L564942 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
L564655 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ Okay.
L564654 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Should I keep reading?
L564653 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ Oh.
L564652 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
L564651 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ So he was mean?
L564650 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L564649 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ The people in the town?
L564648 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
L564647 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
L564646 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ That's right.
L564645 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What, Mason?
L564644 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ Nicole?
L564643 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Okay.
L564642 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
L564641 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
L564640 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
L564639 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L564638 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ Nicole?
L564637 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
L564636 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ What's vermin again?
L564635 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ Oh.
L564634 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ It's like a song.
L564633 +++$+++ u8044 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MASON +++$+++ What's a ditty again?
L564632 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
L565043 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
L565042 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ It was snowing.
L564921 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
L564920 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Why?
L564919 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
L564918 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Dolores.
L564915 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm absolutely positive.
L564914 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You seem very sure about that.
L564913 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
L564912 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
L564911 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I don't want you to lie.
L564910 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I won't lie.
L564909 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
L564907 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
L564906 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
L564902 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
L564901 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
L564900 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
L564897 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You hate that.
L564896 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
L565079 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Thank you, Nicole.
L565078 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I have no questions.
L565041 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ And what was the weather like at this time?
L565040 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
L565035 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
L565034 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
L565028 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I object to that form of question. Note that.
L565027 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
L565018 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Was the bus on time?
L565017 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
L564472 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ No.
L564471 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Have they ever been busted?
L564468 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
L564467 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Crafts?
L564466 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Crafts.
L564465 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What do they do?
L564464 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
L564463 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
L564462 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Yes.
L564461 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Indian?
L564460 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
L564459 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Tell me about the Ottos.
L564453 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ There's the Prescots...
L564452 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
L564449 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ People who will help our cause.
L564448 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L564443 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
L564442 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's the local bar?
L564441 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
L564440 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ When?
L564439 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ She...she was a friend of mine.
L564438 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What about Doreen?
L564421 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
L564420 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Will you be spending more than a night?
L564419 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Do you have a room?
L564406 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks.
L564405 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Here we go.
L564404 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Perfect.
L564403 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Is this it?
L564402 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Almost three.
L564401 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How old is she?
L564400 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L564399 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You always think you're prepared for these things.
L564398 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
L564397 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Need a hand?
L564894 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
L564893 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Oh God, I'm scared.
L564892 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
L564891 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
L564889 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
L564888 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
L564887 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Do you have the blood test?
L564886 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
L564885 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What for?
L564884 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I need money.
L564883 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
L564882 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
L564881 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564880 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I tested positive.
L564879 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564878 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
L564877 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
L564876 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's not news, Zoe.
L564875 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
L564874 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Tell me your news, Zoe.
L564873 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
L564872 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
L564871 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Don't you want to hear?
L564870 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ News?
L564869 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
L564868 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564867 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Daddy?
L564866 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes, I'll accept the charges.
L564396 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
L564395 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Why can't you talk to me?
L564394 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564393 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ DADDY!!!
L564390 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ 'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
L564389 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
L564388 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L564387 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
L564386 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
L564385 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Why are you calling me, Zoe?
L564384 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
L564383 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
L564382 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm in a car wash.
L564567 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Well, let's see what we get.
L564566 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
L564565 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
L564564 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ Yes.
L564563 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Is there shrimp on it?
L564562 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ We do.
L564560 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ Poached salmon.
L564559 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What is it?
L564558 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
L564557 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
L564556 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ Some more wine?
L564609 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Do you have this agreement with you?
L564608 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
L564607 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No.
L564606 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Are you expensive?
L564598 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
L564597 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
L564596 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Excuse me?
L564595 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ So you're just the thing we need.
L564591 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
L564590 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You think someone else caused the accident?
L564589 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
L564588 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Dolores?
L564587 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
L564586 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Who did they get for that?
L564585 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
L564584 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
L564583 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564582 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You've been retained?
L564581 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
L564576 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Please.
L564575 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ No.
L564574 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
L564573 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You can't come here.
L564572 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm a lawyer.
L564571 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Who are you?
L564570 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
L564437 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
L564436 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How does the family survive?
L564435 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
L564434 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
L564433 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Any criminal record?
L564432 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
L564431 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ In what way?
L564430 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
L564423 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No.
L564422 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Are you a reporter?
L565075 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
L565074 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ What do you remember about the accident?
L565072 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
L565071 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You remember this?
L565070 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
L565069 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ There wasn't time?
L565068 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
L565067 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Why not?
L565066 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.
L565065 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
L565064 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L565063 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You saw the speedometer?
L565062 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
L565061 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
L565060 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Positive.
L565059 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
L565058 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Seventy-two miles an hour.
L565057 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
L565056 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
L565055 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You could see the speedometer?
L565054 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
L565053 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
L565052 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Dolores was driving too fast.
L565051 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Why were you scared?
L565050 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
L565049 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
L565048 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Why were you scared?
L565047 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I was scared.
L565046 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Yes.
L565045 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Before the actual accident?
L565044 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
L565039 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L565038 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You are?
L565037 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
L565036 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L565033 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
L565032 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You remember that much?
L565031 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L565030 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
L565029 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.
L565023 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
L565022 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
L565021 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
L565020 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ And where did you sit that morning?
L565019 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L565016 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
L565015 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
L565014 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
L565013 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
L565012 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ About eight-thirty in the morning.
L565011 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ What time in the morning was this?
L565010 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L565009 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
L565105 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
L565104 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There's talk of that.
L565103 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ She'll move away.
L565102 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
L565101 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Will the police do anything to her?
L565100 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L565099 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What's going to happen to Dolores?
L565098 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay.
L565097 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
L565096 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes.
L565006 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Great.
L565005 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
L565004 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
L565003 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
L565002 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What do you mean?
L565001 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
L565000 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Great.
L564999 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
L564998 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.
L564997 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Are you sleeping?
L564954 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ As opposed to this T.V.?
L564953 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nothing good on your T.V.?
L564952 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Nothing.
L564951 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you up to, Nicole?
L564859 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
L564858 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ How will he do that?
L564857 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
L564856 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
L564855 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
L564852 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ But you didn't lose me.
L564851 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
L564844 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
L564843 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.

L564828 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh.  I better get some spackle.
L564827 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
L564824 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
L564823 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ The door needs a lock.
L564821 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
L564820 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ It's okay.
L564819 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Do you like the colour?

L564801 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
L564687 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Does it fit?
L564686 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
L564685 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's that?
L564684 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Nothing.
L564683 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What took so long?
L564428 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
L564427 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's so funny?
L564415 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I am.  Really.  It was awesome.

L564458 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ The Ottos.
L564457 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
L564456 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
L564455 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ But Charlene...
L564454 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
L564451 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L564450 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
