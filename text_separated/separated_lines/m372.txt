L248997 +++$+++ u5589 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ But he was always a bad kid, that one.
L248996 +++$+++ u5598 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
L248995 +++$+++ u5589 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ What? What happened?
L248994 +++$+++ u5598 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Look at Jeannie's kid.
L248993 +++$+++ u5589 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
L248772 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
L248771 +++$+++ u5602 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No more shines, Billy.
L248770 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
L248769 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
L248768 +++$+++ u5602 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
L248767 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
L248766 +++$+++ u5602 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
L248765 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Son of a bitch. Get over here.
L248764 +++$+++ u5602 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Billy, how are you?
L248763 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
L249390 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
L249389 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
L249388 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ You treated me like shit.
L249387 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
L249386 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
L249385 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ You thought I was some fucking jerk?
L249384 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
L249383 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
L249382 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
L249381 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ You think I didn't know what you were doing?
L249380 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I've been all fucked up since I got out.
L249379 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ I warned you a million times.
L249165 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I understand.
L249164 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ Anybody!  You understand?
L249163 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nods again.
L249162 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
L249161 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nods.
L249160 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
L249159 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
L249158 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
L249153 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Why would I get into that?
L249152 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
L249151 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Me? Why would I get into that shit?
L249150 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
L249149 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Wha?  Me?
L249148 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ I don't want any more of that Shit.
L249036 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh I Him.
L249035 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
L249034 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ The guy from near where Christie used to live?
L249033 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ No. No. The guy from downtown.
L249032 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
L249031 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ What did you hear about that thing?
L248891 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ What?
L248890 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Tell him. It's okay.
L249434 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yeah. What about the kids' school?
L249433 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What about the schools?
L249409 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I got scared.
L249408 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
L249407 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I got seared.
L249406 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What happened? You okay?
L249377 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh no! No!  Noooo!
L249376 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
L249375 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
L249374 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
L249373 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
L249372 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You what?
L249371 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I flushed it down the toilet.
L249370 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You know. The stuff I left.
L249369 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L249368 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Where's the stuff?
L249367 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
L249364 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Just get me out.
L249363 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Who's gonna do that?
L249362 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
L249361 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Then you're safer in here.
L249360 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
L249359 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
L249358 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paul will calm down. You'll see.
L249357 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
L249356 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What did he say, exactly?
L249355 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
L249194 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
L249193 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
L249192 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
L249147 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
L249146 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
L249145 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
L249144 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ With what?
L249143 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
L249142 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Never.
L249141 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't want to hear about her anymore.
L249140 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
L249139 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
L249138 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
L249137 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I can't do it anymore.
L249136 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
L249135 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
L249134 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We've got to help each other.
L249133 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
L249132 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It'll be okay.
L249131 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
L249130 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Let her carry this shit inside.
L249129 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Stop! Stop!
L249126 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
L249125 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
L249124 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jezuz Christ!
L249123 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
L249122 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L249121 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You son of a bitch. She's been here.
L249108 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Shit.
L249107 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
L249106 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'm just having my last few drinks.
L249105 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
L249085 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Son of a bitch.
L249084 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
L249083 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
L249080 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
L249079 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Henry.  Wake up.
L249066 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ That again.
L249065 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't care. Something's going on.
L249018 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ How much?
L249017 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm gonna need some money.
L249002 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
L249001 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
L248969 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
L248968 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The bag with the envelopes.
L248967 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What bag?
L248966 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ My bag. My bag.
L248957 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Get inside!
L248956 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What are you gonna do?
L248955 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Go inside. I'll be right there.
L248934 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They don't feel like you're in construction.
L248933 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'm in construction.
L248932 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What do you do?
L248927 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
L248926 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What're you doing? What about the car?
L248921 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
L248920 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Talk? To you? After what you did!
L248919 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
L248918 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
L248917 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Liar!
L248916 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
L248909 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
L248908 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
L248907 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
L249422 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
L249421 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yeah.
L249420 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
L249419 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yeah.
L249418 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
L249417 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ How?
L249416 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
L249415 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
L249414 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
L249304 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
L249303 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
L249295 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
L249294 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I better call again.
L249293 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nah.
L249292 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You want the melon?
L249285 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
L249284 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
L249283 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
L249282 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Watch this.
L249281 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
L249280 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What'll I tell Fran?
L249264 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
L249263 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie's gonna make him?
L249258 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ So what?  Where are they gonna go?

He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
