L634093 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
L634092 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
L634091 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
L634087 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
L634086 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
L634085 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
L634084 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
L634083 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
L634082 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ More or less.
L634081 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
L634080 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
L634079 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You afraid of the dark?
L634078 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
L634077 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
L634076 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
L633906 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
L633905 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
L633904 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ ...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
L633903 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I got things to do.
L633902 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
L633901 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
L633900 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
L633899 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
L633898 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
L633897 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Who's cursed?
L633896 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
L633894 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ ...And everything is nothing too.
L633893 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L633892 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
L633891 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
L633890 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ What do you want for free?
L633889 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I think I've heard that before.
L633888 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
L633887 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Maybe I do.
L633885 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That a fact?
L633884 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
L633883 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
L633380 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
L633379 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hell no!
L633378 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
L633377 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
L633376 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
L633375 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.
L633374 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ That's 'cause he's dead.
L633373 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
L633369 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Christ!
L633368 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
L633366 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ All right, old man.  Christ.
L633365 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
L633364 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, sure.  You got change?
L633363 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
L633362 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I said I was sorry.
L633361 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
L633360 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Christ no!
L633359 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
L633358 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
L633357 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
L633356 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't--
L633355 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
L633354 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You can't do that yourself?
L633353 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
L633352 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You want something?
L633351 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
L633350 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You want something, old man?
L633349 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Hey!  You there!
L634037 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
L634036 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
L634035 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
L634034 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Give it to me!
L634033 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Now, what's this?
L634028 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
L634027 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
L634026 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
L633927 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
L633926 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
L633922 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
L633921 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
L633920 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh, shit!
L633919 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Mister!
L633686 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
L633685 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wasn't hitting on your girl!
L633684 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Stand up.
L633683 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Christ, I don't believe this!
L633682 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
L633681 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
L633680 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ 'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
L633679 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
L633677 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
L633676 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Mister, I'm calling you out.
L633675 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
L633674 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ You expect me to believe that?
L633673 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
L633670 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
L633669 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
L633668 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wasn't doing anything.
L634146 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
L634145 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Two-hundred dollars?
L634144 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
L634143 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
L634137 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
L634136 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Come on, Jake --
L634135 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What are you talking about!
L634134 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
L634128 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
L634127 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
L634126 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
L634125 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
L634124 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's the truth, Jake.
L634123 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Shhh! Liar.
L634122 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You came to take my wife from me?
L634121 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I came for Grace.
L634119 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ ...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
L634118 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
L634117 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
L634116 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's not what you think, Jake.
L634115 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
L634114 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
L634113 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
L633881 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No!
L633880 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Next time you'll do just fine.
L633801 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
L633800 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ ...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
L633799 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And tell her what?
L633798 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
L633797 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
L633796 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
L633795 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
L633794 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
L633793 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How do you want it?
L633792 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
L633791 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
L633790 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
L633789 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
L633788 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
L633787 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's a bit much.
L633786 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I need thirteen.
L633785 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
L633784 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much could you get?
L633782 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
L633781 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You love her, but you hate her?
L633780 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
L633779 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
L633778 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ And what does that make you?
L633777 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
L633776 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What makes you say that?
L633775 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You meant it.
L633774 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
L633773 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
L633772 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
L633771 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
L633770 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're talking like a madman.
L633769 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm not rambling.
L633768 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
L633767 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
L633766 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I did?
L633765 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
L633764 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I do.
L633763 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
L633762 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ About what you said this morning.
L633761 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Sweet Grace?  What about her?
L633760 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ About things.  About your wife.
L633759 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Talk?  About what?
L633758 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I was hoping we could talk.
L633757 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What can I do for you, lad?
L633562 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
L633561 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How do you know if you've never tried?
L633560 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
L633558 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Would you kill her?
L633557 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Would I what?
L633556 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Would you?
L633554 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
L633553 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Like you don't know.
L633552 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ "You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
L633551 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
L633550 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
L633549 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
L633548 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hey!
L633547 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ah, I can smell it on you.
L633546 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Wait a second--
L633545 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
L633544 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
L633543 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
L633542 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
L633541 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Live there?
L633540 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ California...
L633539 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Darrell's a moron.
L633538 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
L633537 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ An overheated car.
L633536 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ "Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
L633535 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bobby Cooper.
L633534 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm a solid man.
L633533 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's a solid name.
L633532 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
L633531 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  More careful.
L633530 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You've got to be--
L633529 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Accident.
L633528 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Say, what happened to your hand?
L633527 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah...
L633526 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
L633524 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
L633523 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck do you want?
L633519 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It ain't broke.
L633518 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You broke my nose!
L633517 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
L633513 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Grace, tell him.
L633512 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ A lot that means.
L633511 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
L633510 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
L633509 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
L633508 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
L633507 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm her husband.
L633506 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Who the hell are you?
L633505 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who the hell is this!?
L634032 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Get away from me!
L634031 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
L633929 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Will you shut up!
L633928 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
L633925 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What's your name anyway?
L633924 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L633923 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
L633918 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
L633917 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
L633916 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How old are you?
L633915 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
L633914 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
L633913 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
L633912 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
L633911 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ But you was going to fight for me.
L633910 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
L633909 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ For defending my honor this afternoon.
L633908 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ For what?
L633907 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
L633663 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You're too quick for me.
L633662 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
L633661 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oz.
L633660 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
L633659 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I've had time to get over it.
L633658 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
L633657 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Cause she's dead.
L633656 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
L633655 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ How about I pick one out for you?
L633654 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That country shit all sounds the same to me.
L633653 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Got any requests?
L633652 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
L633651 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What happened to your hand?
L633650 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
L633649 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L633648 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
L634178 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
L634177 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ No.
L634176 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
L634175 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
L634174 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
L634173 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
L634172 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
L634171 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ You got the money?
L634170 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I want my car.
L634169 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
L634168 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.
L634167 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Open up!
L634166 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ What you want?
L633992 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ When I work on a car, I work on a car.
L633991 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
L633990 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
L633989 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
L633988 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
L633987 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Darrell.
L633986 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Look, Harlin.
L633983 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
L633982 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No! Okay! Okay!
L633980 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
L633979 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
L633978 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
L633977 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
L633976 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
L633975 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What sign?
L633974 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
L633973 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
L633972 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Yeah, but it was shot.
L633971 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
L633970 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
L633969 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
L633968 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
L633967 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L633966 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Two-hundred.
L633965 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
L633964 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ No charge.
L633963 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
L633962 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ You think bad, and bad is what you get.
L633961 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You believe that?
L633960 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
L633959 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You've been there?
L633958 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
L633957 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
L633956 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
L633632 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
L633631 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
L633630 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
L633629 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
L633628 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ ...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
L633625 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
L633624 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't have a goddamn credit card.
L633623 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
L633621 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
L633620 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Then you ain't gonna have the car.
L633619 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
L633618 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
L633617 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
L633616 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ "That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
L633615 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
L633614 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
L633613 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
L633612 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
L633611 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
L633610 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Hundred-fifty.
L633609 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much!?
L633608 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
L633607 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
L633606 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the hell happened to my car?
L633605 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
L633604 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
L633603 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Don't look like nothing.
L633602 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing.
L633601 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
L633600 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hey.
L633345 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
L633344 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
L633343 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
L633342 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
L633341 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Accident.
L633339 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
L633338 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
L633337 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Twenty-after-ten.
L633336 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Time.
L633335 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much time?
L633334 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
L633333 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Great!
L633332 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Yeah, I can fix it.
L633331 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
L633330 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
L633329 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
L633328 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
L633327 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
L633326 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
L633325 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ So?
L633324 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
L633323 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Darrell--
L633322 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
L633321 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
L633320 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
L633319 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ So?
L633318 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ But he's dead.
L633317 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ 'Cause Harlin used to own it.
L633316 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Then why do you call it Harlin's?
L633315 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Yep.
L633314 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You own this place?
L633313 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
L633312 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Will he be back soon?
L633311 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ He's up at the Look Out.
L633310 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Harlin around?
L633309 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Nope.  Darrell.
L633308 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You Harlin?
L633597 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No! No police.
L633596 +++$+++ u8694 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I call the sheriff.
L633570 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Soda.  You know.
L633569 +++$+++ u8694 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
L633568 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Soda.  You got any soda?
L633567 +++$+++ u8694 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Eh?
L633566 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Got any cold soda?
L634299 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
L634298 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ <u>Jake</u>...
L634295 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
L634294 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And I love you too.
L634293 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ 'Cause I love you.
L634292 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Why's that?
L634287 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
L634286 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Can you make it back up?
L634285 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I busted my leg!
L634284 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Bobby? Are you all right?
L634283 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
L634277 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ But we all need that too. Hold him.
L634276 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Hope is a four-letter word.
L634274 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
L634273 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ My mother died in this canyon.
L634272 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Time to go for a walk, Jake.
L634268 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
L634267 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
L634266 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
L634265 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
L634264 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
L634263 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
L634262 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
L634261 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
L634258 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
L634257 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
L634256 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
L634254 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You could give me my gun back.
L634253 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
L634252 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
L634251 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
L634244 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ <u>I don't know why</u>!
L634243 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why?
L634241 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
L634240 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
L634239 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
L634238 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
L634237 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ So, aren't you going to ask me?
L634236 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
L634235 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
L634234 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
L634233 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
L634232 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
L634206 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L634205 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You know I thought you'd left me back there.
L634204 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You already have.
L634203 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
L634202 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
L634201 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Anywhere?
L634200 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
L634199 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ But I thought --
L634198 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm not sailing his boat.
L634197 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
L634196 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
L634195 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
L634194 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
L634193 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
L634192 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know about that?
L634191 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
L634190 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
L634188 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
L634187 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I can't see it.
L634185 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm not coming back.
L634184 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Good thinking.  What's all this?
L634183 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
L634182 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
L634181 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
L634161 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No! You get it!
L634160 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ The money's right here! Get the key!
L634061 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
L634060 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Grace ... Grace?
L634059 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
L634058 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You said you couldn't kill anybody.
L634057 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
L634056 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
L634055 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
L634054 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
L634053 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I could if I had Jake's money.
L634052 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I thought you couldn't get your car.
L634051 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
L634050 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Because I know you're full of shit.
L634049 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
L634048 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Stop it.
L634047 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
L634046 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ There is no us, remember?
L634045 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What about us?
L634044 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't think we have anything to talk about.
L634043 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wanted to talk.
L633871 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
L633870 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
L633869 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Kill him.
L633868 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
L633867 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
L633866 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
L633865 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
L633864 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ In <u>cash</u>?
L633863 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
L633862 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L633861 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
L633860 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where?
L633858 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ ...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
L633857 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
L633856 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You don't have any money put away, do you?
L633855 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
L633854 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
L633853 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
L633852 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
L633851 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is it pretty?
L633850 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
L633849 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L633848 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
L633847 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L633846 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
L633845 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
L633844 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L633843 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
L633842 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You mean the Shaman?
L633841 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing I understand better than a mess.
L633840 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
L633839 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Try me.
L633838 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You'd never understand.
L633837 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
L633836 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
L633835 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Don't feel like nothing.
L633834 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Nothing.
L633833 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's the matter?...Grace?
L633827 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
L633826 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
L633825 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
L633824 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Walk away.
L633823 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't know how.
L633822 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You could leave him.
L633821 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
L633820 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
L633819 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
L633818 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess you're right.
L633817 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm guessing no.
L633816 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
L633815 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Is that why you're with him?
L633814 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
L633813 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Did you ever?
L633812 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No.
L633811 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You love him?
L633810 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
L633809 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Doesn't the isolation bother you?
L633808 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
L633807 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Are there snakes out here?
L633804 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
L633803 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ How do you know he's still not here?
L633802 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
L633503 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
L633502 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You know what I want.
L633501 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
L633500 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Still playing?
L633499 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You never did answer my question.
L633498 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
L633497 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
L633496 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I think I can find my own way back to into town.
L633495 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
L633494 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
L633492 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And what would that be?
L633491 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I have an idea.
L633490 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
L633489 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing like a little liveliness.
L633488 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
L633487 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Beautiful?
L633486 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Like you.
L633485 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
L633484 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Lift me down.
L633483 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L633482 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ There.  All done.  Lift me down.
L633478 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ The same thing you do.
L633477 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
L633476 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ My face tell you all that?
L633474 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Come here.
L633473 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
L633472 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Those are white words, not ours.
L633471 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ A medicine man?
L633470 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
L633469 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where'd you learn to do that?
L633468 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
L633467 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What do you do anyway?
L633466 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I guess it must.
L633465 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
L633462 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Thank you.
L633461 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nice place.
L633460 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
L633459 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
L633458 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Did you like it; me watching you?
L633457 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I didn't say it bothered me.
L633456 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
L633455 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
L633446 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I pack up and go somewhere else.
L633445 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What happens when you lose?
L633444 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
L633443 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
L633442 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
L633441 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ So, what is it you do, Mister...?
L633440 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
L633439 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Where you headed?
L633438 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I guess I've got wander in my blood.
L633437 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You've been around.
L633436 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
L633435 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Where you coming from?
L633422 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
L633421 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
L633420 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
L633419 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
L633418 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Drove into Superior?  What for?
L633417 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I just drove in this morning.
L633416 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
L633415 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
L633414 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're not from around here, are you?
L633413 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You're welcome, Grace.
L633412 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Thank you, Bobby.
L633407 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's all right.  I got it.
L633406 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
L633405 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Wasn't nothing.
L633404 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No trouble at all, really.
L633403 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
L633402 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You should be more careful.
L633401 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Accident.
L633400 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What happened to your hand?
L633399 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, I've got it.
L633397 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
L633396 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I got it.
L633395 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You sure you can manage?
L633394 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Jesus.
L633393 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ May I carry your package, Grace?
L633392 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's Grace.
L633391 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I like that about me, beautiful.
L633390 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
L633389 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
L633388 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I don't want you to.
L633387 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know your real name.
L633386 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Do you have to call me that?
L633385 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
L633384 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
L633383 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's right on my way.
L633382 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm just going to my car?
L633381 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
L633948 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
L633947 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
L633946 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
L633945 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ That's a nasty cut you got there.
L633944 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
L633943 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
L633942 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Get in.
L633941 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Harlin's.
L633940 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Where ya goin'?
L633429 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
L633428 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Morning, officer.
L633743 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
L633742 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ What'd you say to me!
L633740 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
L633739 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
L633738 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ ...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
L633737 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, if you could send it care of...
L633736 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
L633735 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ Which you don't have.
L633734 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.

L634228 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ ...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
L634227 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
L634224 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
L634223 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?

L633431 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
L633430 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Anybody hurt?

L634097 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
L634073 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.

L634068 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ They look nice.
L634067 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You never said anything.  About the drapes.

L634065 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I put up new drapes, Jake.
L634064 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
L634063 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Wrong number.
L634062 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who was that on the phone?
L634030 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
L634029 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
L633937 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I said come on!

L633671 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
L633667 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
L633666 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
L633665 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I axed you a question.
