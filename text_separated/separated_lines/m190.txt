L533279 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
L533278 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
L533153 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Plenty.
L533152 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L533136 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
L533135 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ They never caught on.
L533134 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ I wouldn't talk about things like that.
L533133 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
L533170 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
L533169 +++$+++ u2891 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ P.O.W.S +++$+++ Jawohl!
L533168 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Is you all little Adolfs?
L533167 +++$+++ u2891 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ P.O.W.S +++$+++ Jawohl.
L533166 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Is you all good Nazis?
L533165 +++$+++ u2891 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ P.O.W.S +++$+++ Jawohl.
L533474 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
L533473 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
L533472 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Don't worry. He'll be all right.
L533471 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
L533413 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
L533412 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What's the match gag?
L533411 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Just pulled the old match gag, see!
L533410 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
L533409 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
L533408 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
L533394 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
L533393 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Any news on Dunbar?
L533392 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ We made a deal with Barrack One.
L533282 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
L533281 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
L533555 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Get going on the trap door.
L533554 +++$+++ u2882 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BLONDIE +++$+++ Coming up.
L533553 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
L533500 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Okay. Move on.
L533499 +++$+++ u2882 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BLONDIE +++$+++ Roger.
L533498 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Ready?
L532942 +++$+++ u2882 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BLONDIE +++$+++ Static!
L532941 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Come on!
L532714 +++$+++ u2882 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BLONDIE +++$+++ Looks good outside.
L532713 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
L533615 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ So long, Sefton.
L533614 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
L533470 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Yeah. Security.
L533469 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
L533468 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ Who is it?
L533467 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
L533466 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ Who is it?
L533465 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
L533464 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ In this barracks?
L533463 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
L533462 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ I don't know anymore.
L533461 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
L533143 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ We'll get some more.
L533142 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ There's only one pair left.
L532735 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ That'll do.
L532734 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
L533603 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Forget it.
L533602 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Brother, were we all wet about you!
L533568 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We're looking at it.
L533567 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
L533507 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
L533506 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
L533505 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
L533422 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Thanks.
L533421 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Have a cigar.
L533400 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Why not?
L533399 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
L533398 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Take it.
L533397 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
L533255 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
L533254 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You make my mouth water.
L533253 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
L533252 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
L533039 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ A little something what?
L533038 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And maybe a little something else?
L533037 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
L533034 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
L533033 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
L533032 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ That's right.
L533031 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
L532944 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
L532943 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
L532901 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You stink, Sefton!
L532900 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
L532899 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
L532898 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
L532895 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
L532894 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
L532891 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
L532890 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
L532823 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
L532822 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Private property, bub.
L532748 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Anybody here wanna double their bet?
L532747 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
L532721 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
L532720 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Now what kind of a crack is that?
L533537 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
L533536 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Then we're all in on it?
L533491 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
L533490 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
L533229 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
L533228 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ How did he get over there?
L533043 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
L533042 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How much more do we have to take from him?
L533041 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Break it off!
L532831 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
L532830 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Come again?
L532741 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Okay, Security -- what happened?
L532740 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
L532730 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I'll call the whole pot.
L532729 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Put me down for ten, you louse.
L532970 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You are talking crazy!
L532969 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
L532966 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Which one of you is what?
L532965 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
L532962 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Tipping me off? I do not understand.
L532961 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
L532759 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Don't wear it out!
L532758 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
L532757 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You killed them, huh? Both of them?
L533646 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Let's!
L533645 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Let's blow, Chauncey.
L533635 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
L533634 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ What are the chances busting out of here?
L533633 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You won't get off that cheap.
L533632 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ It's on me.
L533631 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
L533630 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah.
L533629 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What some brandy?
L533628 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Not you.
L533627 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
L533626 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Sefton!
L533625 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
L533624 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ My legs are frozen.
L533623 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
L533150 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
L533149 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
L533148 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
L533116 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
L533115 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Twenty-five.
L533114 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
L533112 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
L533111 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
L533373 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
L533372 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
L533371 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
L533361 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
L533360 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
L533359 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
L533355 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
L533354 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
L533353 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
L533352 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You are being rude again.
L533351 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
L533350 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
L533349 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
L533275 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Abfuehren!
L533274 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Ever try forty sleeping pills?
L533273 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
L533272 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I'm okay here. Why bother?
L533271 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
L533270 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
L533269 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
L533268 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I'll live.
L533267 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
L533266 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ 105-353.
L533265 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ What is your number?
L533264 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
L533331 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
L533330 +++$+++ u2887 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GERMAN LIEUTENANT +++$+++ The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
L533329 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
L533328 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
L533327 +++$+++ u2887 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GERMAN LIEUTENANT +++$+++ As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
L533326 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
L533325 +++$+++ u2887 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GERMAN LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
L533383 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
L533382 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
L533381 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ Isn't it?
L533380 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Interesting.
L533379 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
L533378 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You were saying --?
L533376 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
L533375 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
L533374 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
L533370 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
L533369 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
L533368 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ What exactly is he charged with?
L533367 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ It is.
L533366 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
L533365 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
L533190 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ And this?
L533189 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's a mouse trap.
L533188 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ What is this? This is water?
L532974 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Raus! Raus! All of you!
L532973 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
L532957 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
L532956 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
L532950 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You should live so long.
L532949 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
L532948 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
L532790 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Some are not bad at all.
L532789 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Jawohl!
L532771 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
L532770 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Then droppen Sie dead!
L532769 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Jawohl.
L532768 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sprechen Sie deutsch?
L532767 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Jawohl?
L532766 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Say, Schulz --
L532765 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
L533541 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No. I want to draw.
L533540 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You want to go?
L533539 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let me do it, Hoffy.
L533488 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
L533487 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Betty! Betty!
L533486 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Animal! Animal! Wake up!
L533485 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
L533484 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, Animal! Animal!
L533483 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
L533478 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why, sure!
L533477 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ May I have this dance, Miss?
L533457 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
L533456 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
L533455 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ It's that song, Harry!
L533454 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're crying, Animal.
L533453 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Let me alone.
L533452 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
L533429 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ I'll open mine, too.
L533428 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'll open mine now.
L533426 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Animal! Got a little something for you!
L533425 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
L533417 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, here's Esther Williams.
L533416 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Do Grable.
L533407 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Do Jimmy Durante!
L533406 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Grable, not Gable!
L533212 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
L533211 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
L533197 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You hold him. I'll slug him.
L533196 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
L533093 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
L533092 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
L533091 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
L533090 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
L533089 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's not good for you, Animal.
L533088 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ That's what I wanna hear.
L533087 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What do they always say?
L533086 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ What do those broads say?
L533018 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
L533017 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Harry -- I'm blind!
L533011 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Bombs away!
L533010 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ She'll never forgive me!
L533009 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ To the Brick Kremlin!
L533008 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
L533007 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You did?
L533006 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
L533005 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
L533004 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
L533003 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You'll fix me up!
L533002 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
L533001 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Not for me! Betty! Betty!
L533000 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So what? There's other women!
L532999 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
L532993 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
L532992 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
L532991 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
L532988 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
L532987 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
L532939 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ He's the grrrrreatest!
L532938 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
L532897 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
L532896 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
L532887 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
L532886 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
L532880 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
L532879 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
L532876 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Where'd that come from?
L532875 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Easy, Animal! Easy!
L532873 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
L532872 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ No?
L532871 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No, Animal.
L532861 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
L532860 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You're teasing me again!
L532859 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
L532858 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Me? What if she don't want me?
L532857 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
L532856 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ What's the award?
L532855 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
L532854 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
L532853 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
L532852 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Betty Grable!
L532851 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Let me go!
L532850 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You want Betty Grable!
L532849 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ I don't care if they wear galoshes!
L532848 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
L532847 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
L532846 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's chow, Animal! Chow!
L532844 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ They'll shoot you, Animal!
L532843 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Let me go! Let me go!
L532840 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Lay off! The blonde is mine!
L532839 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
L532838 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
L532836 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
L532835 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
L532821 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
L532820 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
L532819 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You can say that again!
L532818 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
L532817 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ 'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
L532780 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
L532779 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
L532778 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
L532777 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Why do you do this to me every morning?
L532776 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
L532775 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Stop it, Harry!
L532774 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
L532745 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
L532744 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Shut up, Animal!
L532711 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
L532710 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ When you get going on those broads, think of me!
L533277 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
L533276 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
L533263 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L533262 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ ...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
L533261 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You have a Lieutenant here...
L533260 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L533259 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
L532808 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
L532807 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
L532806 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Anything else?
L532805 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
L532804 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
L532803 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
L533559 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
L533558 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Why the south latrine?
L533557 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
L533556 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
L533548 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Any objections, men?
L533547 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
L533546 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ We've all done a poor job of it.
L533545 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
L533544 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
L533514 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
L533513 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What about Schulz?
L533504 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Good.
L533503 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
L533502 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
L533501 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
L533493 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
L533492 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L533199 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
L533198 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
L533157 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
L533156 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
L533036 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
L533035 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Not yet.
L532964 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
L532963 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
L532925 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
L532924 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
L532825 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
L532824 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
L533437 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
L533436 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
L533182 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
L533181 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ What radio?
L533180 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
L533179 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
L532764 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
L532763 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
L532762 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
L532761 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Los, los. Dummkopf!
L533620 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Check.
L533619 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
L533618 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You could use a new one yourself.
L533612 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Shoot!
L533611 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
L533610 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ What's the decoy?
L533609 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
L533608 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
L533607 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ You taking Dunbar?
L533605 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
L533604 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ What are we going to do with him?
L533592 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
L533591 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Go on.
L533580 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
L533579 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ You off your rocker?
L533578 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You did!
L533577 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Who did?
L533576 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You told them, Hoffy.
L533575 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ How do they know?
L533572 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I called it the last time, didn't I?
L533571 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
L533570 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
L533569 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
L533563 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Anybody cover?
L533562 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ You starting that again?
L533561 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
L533512 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Okay, Price. You stay.
L533511 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
L533510 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Right.
L533509 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
L533508 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
L533322 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
L533321 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ You heard that, Sefton?
L533257 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
L533256 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ What's it add up to you, Sefton?
L533249 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
L533248 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ We did it.
L533247 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
L533242 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Borscht?
L533241 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
L533240 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
L533119 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
L533118 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
L533117 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Lay off, Sefton.
L533028 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
L533027 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
L533026 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Says me.
L533025 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Says who?
L533024 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
L532935 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Are we boring you?
L532934 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
L532889 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ A little weak today.
L532888 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
L532725 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
L532724 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Anybody call?
L532706 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
L532705 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Stay out of it, Sefton.
L533068 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Oh.
L533067 +++$+++ u2890 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ MARKO +++$+++ Give this to Joey, will you?

Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp.
L532915 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You can tell Father Murray to --

L533590 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
L533589 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
L533588 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What time?
L533587 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ December seventh, forty-one.
L533586 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
L533585 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I'll kill you for that!
L533584 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
L533583 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
L533582 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
L533581 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
L533574 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ The Germans know where Dunbar is.
L533573 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
L533531 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
L533530 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
L533529 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
L533528 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What did you say?
L533527 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Ach so!
L533526 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
L533525 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
L533524 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
L533523 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Are you questioning me?
L533522 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?

L533520 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
L533519 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
L533518 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
L533517 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
L533516 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
L533251 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What about the radio?
L533250 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
L533030 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
L533029 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
L532908 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
L532907 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
L532906 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ And what's that crack supposed to mean?
L532905 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
L532904 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
L532903 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
L533446 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
L533445 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Wie hat er's gemacht?
L533444 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Ich weiss alles.
L533443 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
L533186 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
L533185 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ We have no radio.
L533184 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Give me the radio.
L533183 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Schulz, you're off your nut!
L532968 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
L532967 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Which one of us is the informer?
L532786 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
L532785 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
L532784 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
L532756 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
L532755 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
L533439 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Not particularly.
L533438 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
L533307 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ How many do you want? A thousand?
L533306 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Talk what? I do not know anything!
L533305 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
L533304 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ No! No!
L533303 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I'll make it five hundred!
L533302 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Yes, you do!
L533301 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ I do not want those cigarettes.
L533300 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
L533299 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ What guy?
L533298 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Who's the guy, Schulz?
L533297 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
L533296 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
L533295 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
L533294 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Here. Take them.
L533293 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
L533292 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
L533291 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
L532972 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
L532971 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
L532783 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Fine -- fine!
L532782 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
L532781 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Good morning, Sefton.
L533192 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
L533191 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ My grandmother's ear-muffs.
L533178 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
L533177 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
L533176 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
L532960 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
L532959 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
L532958 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
L532955 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
L532954 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
L532953 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ That is my wife.
L532952 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
L532951 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ This is me in Cincinnati.
L532947 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
L532946 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
L532945 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
L532792 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
L532791 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
L532788 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Russian women prisoners?
L532787 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
L533617 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
L533616 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
L533596 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
L533595 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You heard him.
L533316 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
L533315 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ So you're stuck with me, eh?
L533244 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Oh! Somebody was peeking!
L533243 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Have a nice time over there?
L533056 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
L533055 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
L532893 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
L532892 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
L532883 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Just don't drool on it.
L532882 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Is it all right if we smell it?
L532878 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ A chicken?
L532877 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ From a chicken, bug-wit.
