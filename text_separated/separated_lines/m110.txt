L334179 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Adele for god sake please lis...
L334178 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
L334177 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
L334176 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
L333905 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I suppose anything's possible.
L333904 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You lose!
L333812 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
L333811 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No.
L334152 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
L334151 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
L334148 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ That's not true!
L334147 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What?
L334146 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...That's not true.
L334145 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ The police are after him, he's a murderer!
L333971 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Jeez... Adele!
L333970 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
L333969 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Anything else?
L333968 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Carryin' a gun.
L333967 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What's Early been in jail for?
L333966 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
L333945 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L333944 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
L333943 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Adele... are you serious?
L333942 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Do what?
L333941 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ You shouldn't let him do that to you...
L333940 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
L333939 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Hold still.
L333938 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No it is not!
L333937 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ That's me.
L333936 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Took 'em all.
L333935 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You took this picture?
L333933 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Sure.
L333932 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
L333931 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ It's a portfolio of my work.
L333930 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ What's this?
L333929 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Could I try that?
L333928 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I'm cool.
L333918 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You can?
L333917 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
L333913 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ How'd you meet Early?
L333912 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
L333890 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
L333889 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
L333879 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ He whips you?
L333878 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Better not, or Early'd whip me.
L333877 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ So you don't do any of those things.
L333876 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
L333872 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
L333871 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ You dropped this.
L333778 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Yeah, sure.
L333777 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
L333750 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Not really.
L333749 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Is it hard to learn?
L333748 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Yeah.
L333747 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Are you takin' the pictures?
L333744 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ That French ain't it?
L333743 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
L333742 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ What?
L333741 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Karma.
L333740 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
L333730 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Thank you.
L333729 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...I said, I like your hair.
L333728 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Pardon?
L333726 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Carrie.
L333725 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Hi, I'm Adele.
L334212 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
L334211 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
L334208 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early! Stop!!
L334207 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
L334185 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
L334184 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ What's wrong with her?
L334169 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
L334168 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...I don't know.
L334167 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
L334166 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...thank you.
L334099 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
L334098 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Yeah but, what is it?
L334097 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
L334096 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ What the hell is this stuff?
L334063 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
L334062 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early, what're you doin'?
L333825 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early, sing me a song.
L333824 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
L333784 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
L333783 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Shush, Adele.
L333722 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ As many times as it takes.
L333721 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ How many times you gonna tell me that?
L333720 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ You just smile, let me do all the talking.
L333719 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Geez, they look kinda weird.
L333712 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
L333711 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
L333709 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
L333708 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ What if they're dangerous?
L333697 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ I heard that.
L333696 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
L333695 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
L333694 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
L333693 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
L333692 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ What'll we do out there?
L333691 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
L333690 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
L333689 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
L333686 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Almost.
L333685 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
L333599 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
L333598 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
L333597 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early, you are so sweet.
L333596 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Happy birthday Adele.
L334082 +++$+++ u1671 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ No sir.
L334081 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
L334080 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ What do you need a Bible for?
L334079 +++$+++ u1671 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ ...Mind if I hold that Bible?
L334077 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
L334076 +++$+++ u1671 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Turkey mostly.
L334075 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Never heard of it, any huntin'?
L334074 +++$+++ u1671 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Vernon, Florida.
L334073 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Where you from Walter?
L334068 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ I don't know. Wish I did.
L334067 +++$+++ u1671 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Not so good. You sure you have to?
L334066 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
L334065 +++$+++ u1671 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Walter Livesy.
L334064 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ What's your name, boy?
L334221 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
L334220 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What happened to Adele?
L334219 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ You two been busy in here.
L334132 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
L334131 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...and?
L334130 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
L334129 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ So tell me... what happened here?
L334123 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
L334122 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Forget about it, doesn't matter.
L334121 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
L334116 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ ...Ha.
L334115 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
L334110 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Damn right I do.
L334109 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ If you say so.
L334108 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...Well then, that's how many I killed.
L333980 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
L333979 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
L333926 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Nah... how much money have you got?
L333925 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
L333924 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
L333923 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah?
L333922 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
L333921 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
L333901 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Ain't you goin' to record it?
L333900 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Sure.
L333899 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ You wanna hear mine?
L333898 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L333897 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
L333896 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
L333895 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
L333894 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
L333893 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Now why is that?
L333892 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Dahlia, no.
L333891 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
L333883 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...Then some.
L333882 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ That bad?
L333870 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
L333869 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
L333867 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
L333866 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
L333865 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Henry Lucas.
L333864 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Who?
L333863 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ This guy killed a mess of people.
L333862 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
L333861 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ This the book your writing?
L333774 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Forget it.
L333773 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ How much do I owe you?
L333772 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Can't hurt.
L333753 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...Too bad.
L333752 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
L333751 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
L333739 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
L333738 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So what do you do Early?
L333736 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
L333735 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Brian.
L333734 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
L333733 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
L333732 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Best kind.
L333731 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Tight fit.
L334217 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I don't know.
L334216 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What about you?
L334215 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
L334214 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L334213 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Carrie, watch for Early.
L334194 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Then try again, 
L334193 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
L334192 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
L334174 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
L334173 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
L334172 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Carrie... stop it.
L334044 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
L334043 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Why, what did he do?
L334042 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Brian I want him out of our car!
L334041 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
L334040 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
L334039 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I can't believe I agreed to do this.
L334038 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
L334037 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
L334034 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I'm finished.
L334033 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ There's more...
L334029 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
L334028 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What's that?
L334018 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Look again!
L334017 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What is it?
L333998 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
L333997 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
L333993 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
L333992 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ How do you know that?
L333991 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
L333989 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
L333988 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Who said he's my good buddy?
L333860 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Take your time.
L333859 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Fuck!
L333858 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ All set?
L333833 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L333832 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Carrie.
L333831 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
L333830 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ ...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
L333822 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I heard that.
L333821 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Up yours.
L333820 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Bitch, bitch, bitch!
L333819 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
L333818 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
L333817 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
L333804 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
L333803 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
L333718 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Lighten up...
L333717 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
L333705 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Funny, very funny.
L333704 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
L333702 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
L333701 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I still think we should have met them first.
L333700 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I like that.
L333699 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
L333698 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What did he sound like on the phone?
L333666 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
L333665 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
L333664 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
L333663 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
L333662 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ A book on the warehouse murders?
L333661 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
L333660 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
L333659 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
L333658 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Why?
L333657 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ ...and I think I know why.
L333656 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ ...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
L333655 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ So how's it going?
L333654 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
L333653 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Thanks. What are you doing?
L333652 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
L333629 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
L333628 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ ...just like that?
L333627 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
L333626 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
L333625 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
L333624 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ ...I do.
L333623 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ I thought you wanted to be a writer.
L333605 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
L333604 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
L333603 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ It was definitely the high point of the evening.
L333602 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
L333601 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ The party?
L333600 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
L333589 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ A... I gotta go.
L333588 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
L333587 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
L333580 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Thank god!
L333579 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
L333572 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
L333571 +++$+++ u1673 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
L333569 +++$+++ u1673 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
L333568 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
L333567 +++$+++ u1673 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
L333566 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
L333565 +++$+++ u1673 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Nervous?
L333564 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Not yet.
L333563 +++$+++ u1673 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Any word from that gallery?
L334239 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
L334238 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...You know what I mean?
L334236 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
L334235 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ You were plenty hot.
L334232 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...You're hurting me...
L334231 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
L334171 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
L334170 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
L334094 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Everybody just shut up!
L334093 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
L334070 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Shut your mouth.
L334069 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Early, just think...
L334027 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Siesta.
L334026 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
L334012 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ No, never. Excuse me.
L334011 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...never?
L334006 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ No.
L334005 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
L334004 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Brian hurt his foot.
L334003 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
L333856 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ No, thanks, I can manage.
L333855 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ ...Need a hand with those bags?
L333846 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ She wasn't feeling so good.
L333845 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Where's Adele?
L333844 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Bri'.
L333649 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
L333648 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ ...Janitor's job.
L333647 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ What is it?
L333646 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
L333641 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
L333640 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ ...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
L333637 +++$+++ u1675 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ EARLY +++$+++ Wasn't my fault...
L333636 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
L333768 +++$+++ u1677 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
L333767 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
L333766 +++$+++ u1677 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ ...That'd be my guess.
L333765 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ ...Diebold?
L333763 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
L333762 +++$+++ u1677 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
L333761 +++$+++ u1677 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ Without his car?
L333760 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
L333759 +++$+++ u1677 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ Where would we find him?
L333758 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ Could be.
L333757 +++$+++ u1677 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
L333756 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ His Parole Officer.
L333755 +++$+++ u1677 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ Who are you?
L333754 +++$+++ u1676 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ PAROLE OFFICER +++$+++ What happened?
