L52772 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Game over, bitch!
L52743 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
L52742 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
L52741 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why don't you tell me.
L52740 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
L52739 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You would be.
L52738 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
L52737 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
L52736 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Oh, yeah.
L52735 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
L52734 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What?
L52733 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
L52732 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
L52731 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ That's right.
L52730 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Five million dollars?
L52728 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
L52727 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
L52726 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
L52725 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ I ain't scared of you.
L52724 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
L52720 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
L52719 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What does that fucking mean?
L52718 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
L52717 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
L52141 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I know you're going to jump.
L52140 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
L52136 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
L52135 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L52134 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What?  What's okay?
L52133 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Okay.
L52131 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Bullshit.
L52130 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ We go around once.
L52129 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ So what happens now?
L52128 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
L52127 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
L52126 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
L52124 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
L52123 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Tachlinkov.
L52122 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
L52119 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ We both know what you were doing.
L52118 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
L52110 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Sounds like chickenshit --
L52109 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
L52108 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
L52107 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Two years.  Two long fucking years.
L52106 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ How long have you been freelance?
L52105 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Bain.  Michael Bain.
L52104 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
L52103 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
L52102 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
L52098 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Okay, don't.
L52097 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ No fucking way.
L52096 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
L52091 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
L52090 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ You can't --
L52089 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
L52088 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L52087 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Just do your job.
L52086 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What?  You think I'm running you up?
L52085 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
L52084 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You're right.  Talking too much again.
L52083 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
L52082 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What?
L52081 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L52079 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
L52078 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Probably.
L52077 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
L52076 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L52075 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
L52074 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ No shit.
L52073 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
L52072 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Why?  What happened?
L52070 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
L52069 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
L52068 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Not too good at small talk, eh?
L52067 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What is this?
L52066 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Where you from?
L52065 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ No.  No I'm not.
L52064 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ So you're from around here?
L52063 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Uh, Fontella's
L52062 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What restaurant?
L52061 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What?
L52060 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Where?
L52059 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
L52055 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Right.
L52054 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
L52053 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Is there a problem?
L52430 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Do you want Rath or not?
L52429 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ How in the fuck do you know that?
L52428 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
L52427 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Such language in front of a lady.
L52424 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What?
L52423 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
L52422 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
L52421 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Michael?
L52417 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ You're too late.
L52416 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ I'm on the scent.
L52462 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Take us there.
L52461 +++$+++ u3792 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CABBY +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
L52460 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
L52459 +++$+++ u3792 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CABBY +++$+++ Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
L52458 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
L52457 +++$+++ u3792 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CABBY +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L52456 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
L52194 +++$+++ u3792 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CABBY +++$+++ Sure.
L52193 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
L52521 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Paid in full.
L52520 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ The contract?
L52519 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Hello, Robert.
L52189 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
L52188 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ Who is the mark?
L52187 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
L52186 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ Deadline?
L52181 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ I know.  It was a joke.
L52180 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ I don't know what the fuck you are.
L52178 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know.
L52177 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Know what?
L52176 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ How did he know?
L52026 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
L52025 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ Who?
L52024 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ The contract was stolen.
L52023 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ What?
L52019 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ I'm worried about you, Robert.
L52018 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
L52011 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L52010 +++$+++ u3799 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH/SCREEN +++$+++ Sick.  The flu.
L52009 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Where have you been, Robert?
L52191 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
L52190 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ A player?
L52184 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ $1,000,000.
L52183 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You think this is a fucking joke?
L52175 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ Robert?  Robert?
L52174 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Is this how it went, Nick?
L52172 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ He stole another contract.
L52171 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
L52170 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ It cost us.
L52169 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I bet you fucking know!
L52168 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ I know what happened.
L52015 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
L52014 +++$+++ u3793 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ CONTRACTOR/SCREEN +++$+++ I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
L52751 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Oh, God.  I see it!
L52750 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
L52716 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52715 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Was nice.
L52714 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Last night --
L52713 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?
L52712 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Electra --
L52711 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Okay.
L52710 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'm taking off my mike.
L52709 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Right.
L52708 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Wait until he is on the stairs.
L52707 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Shit.
L52706 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I waited another four minutes.
L52705 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?
L52704 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Four minutes.
L52671 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Martin.
L52670 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Martin.
L52667 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
L52666 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'm not normal.
L52665 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ That doesn't sound normal.
L52664 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why?
L52663 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
L52662 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
L52661 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L52660 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Honestly?
L52659 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ When did it start?
L52658 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52657 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Were you attracted to me right away?
L52656 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'm not sure that I care anymore.
L52655 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Is this becoming complicated?
L52654 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
L52653 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Was she the only one?
L52652 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
L52651 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Did you --
L52650 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ She was taken.
L52649 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What happened to her?
L52648 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
L52647 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Who was she?
L52646 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52645 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ It happened to you before?
L52644 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It can be.
L52643 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Attraction is a complication?
L52642 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I didn't want to complicate the situation.
L52641 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
L52640 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Both.
L52639 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
L52638 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why?  I don't know.
L52637 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52636 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52635 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Are you attracted to me?
L52634 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52633 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Am I attractive?
L52632 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'm sure you will.
L52631 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
L52630 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
L52629 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because, I'll take it.
L52628 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52627 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ That's a ridiculous move.
L52626 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?
L52625 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What are you doing?
L52624 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
L52623 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Did he explain how this happened?
L52622 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
L52621 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
L52620 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
L52619 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ And you were drilling these holes...?
L52618 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
L52617 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why?
L52616 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I know.  It makes me crazy.
L52615 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
L52614 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ No?
L52613 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52612 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
L52611 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Thank you.
L52610 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
L52609 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
L52608 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why in the hell would you take that chance?
L52607 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Nobody ever sees me.
L52606 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Jesus, if someone had --
L52605 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
L52604 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What?
L52603 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I went into their room this afternoon.
L52602 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ How do you know they're not?
L52601 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ When I first saw them I thought they were married.
L52600 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I didn't notice them.
L52599 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Did you think they were newlyweds?
L52596 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ So?
L52595 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ They're worth less points.
L52594 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
L52593 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
L52591 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
L52590 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I think I got one today.
L52589 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52588 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Do you have ulcers?
L52586 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.  Here I am again.
L52585 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Ten years later, here you are again.
L52584 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
L52583 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You didn't take it.
L52582 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
L52581 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Was that it?
L52580 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
L52579 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What did he say?
L52578 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
L52577 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What did he want?
L52576 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
L52575 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What happened?
L52574 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52573 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Ten years ago.
L52572 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
L52571 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I don't believe that.
L52570 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
L52569 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
L52568 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
L52567 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52566 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ For Nicholai?
L52565 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
L52564 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I was.
L52563 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
L52562 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I told you, he will.
L52561 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
L52560 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What?
L52559 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Except --
L52558 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I've been thinking about it for a long time.
L52557 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Sounds pretty well figured out.
L52556 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
L52555 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ We split the money?
L52554 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
L52553 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
L52552 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
L52551 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
L52550 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ That's right.
L52549 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ That means you won't have a gun.
L52548 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
L52547 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?  What if he brings it with him?
L52546 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
L52545 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
L52544 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
L52543 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
L52542 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
L52541 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Then, we wait.
L52540 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Okay.  Then what?
L52539 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
L52538 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
L52537 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ But he won't shoot you right then?
L52536 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
L52535 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Check.
L52534 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
L52533 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Fine.
L52532 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
L52531 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
L52530 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I paid a lot for these.
L52529 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Cheap as shit.
L52528 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Transmits and receives.
L52527 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Two way?
L52516 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
L52515 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I've always wanted to learn something like that.
L52514 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Thank you.
L52513 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
L52512 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Taiwan.
L52511 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Where did you learn it?
L52508 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ The beach?  It was nice.
L52507 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ How was the beach?
L52506 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Sorry.
L52505 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You should knock.
L52504 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
L52503 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
L52502 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Really?
L52501 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Okay.
L52500 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
L52499 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
L52498 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Breakfast.
L52496 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
L52495 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What do you think he's doing?
L52494 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52493 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ In Costa Blanca.
L52492 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Here?
L52491 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Do you think he's here?
L52489 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
L52488 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
L52487 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ That sounds nice.
L52486 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
L52485 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
L52483 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What happens if you do?
L52482 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52481 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Not even a stalemate?
L52480 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52479 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ But you've never figured out a way to win.
L52478 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52477 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Do you think about the game?
L52476 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Work.  The things I need to get done.
L52475 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Oh.  What do you think about?
L52474 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
L52473 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why not?
L52472 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52466 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
L52465 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?
L52464 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ That's where he'll be.
L52454 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You were there?
L52453 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't know.
L52452 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
L52451 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Nothing.
L52450 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ About?
L52449 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Thinking.
L52448 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Hey, where are you?
L52445 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Mexico.
L52444 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Where is it?
L52443 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Good.
L52442 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Several.
L52441 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you have a passport?
L52437 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't.
L52436 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You said you didn't trust it.
L52435 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
L52411 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ No.  Something honest.
L52410 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
L52407 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Does that mean it didn't bother you?
L52406 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
L52405 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ That's fiction.
L52404 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Did it ever bother James Bond?
L52403 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Did it ever bother you?
L52402 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ They become complicated... messy.
L52401 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ After that?
L52400 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  Just the first one.
L52399 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Are they usually like that?
L52398 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
L52397 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Because I want to know.
L52396 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why?
L52395 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Yes.
L52394 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ My first take?
L52393 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Tell me about the first time.
L52392 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
L52391 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Then you went freelance?
L52390 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
L52389 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ They tried to kill you?
L52388 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
L52387 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why did you leave the Agency?
L52386 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because you are a women.
L52385 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52384 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
L52383 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why not?
L52382 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Women?  No... not really.
L52381 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ The exotic women.
L52380 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
L52379 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Ahhhh...
L52378 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
L52377 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ But you knew what they were training you for?
L52376 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No, they didn't.
L52375 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ They didn't give you a choice, did they?
L52374 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
L52373 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You went from high school to the Agency?
L52372 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I was just different.
L52371 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why not?
L52370 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Some people said that.  I never thought so.
L52369 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You were like a boy genius?
L52368 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
L52367 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Jesus -- why?
L52366 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ They recruited me when I was in high school.
L52365 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ How old were you?
L52364 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ More or less.
L52363 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ The C.I.A.?
L52362 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
L52361 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ How did you get into the business?
L52360 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
L52359 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Where you wanted to be?
L52358 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
L52357 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52356 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I killed him.
L52354 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ He was killed.
L52353 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He was... taken.
L52352 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why didn't you finish this game?
L52351 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
L52350 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ It looks like white's game.
L52348 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
L52347 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Had?
L52345 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Better than playing with yourself.
L52344 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's not the same, is it?
L52343 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ With computers.
L52341 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
L52340 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because I'm done.
L52339 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52338 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52337 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
L52336 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L52335 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
L52334 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ No.  Just Electra.
L52333 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ As in daughter of Agamemnon?
L52332 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Yeah.
L52331 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Just Electra?
L52330 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Electra.
L52329 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Rath.  Robert Rath.
L52328 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Listen -- I don't even know your name.
L52323 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
L52322 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Oh Jesus Jesus...
L52321 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
L52320 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ How?
L52319 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
L52318 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
L52317 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
L52316 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52315 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
L52314 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
L52313 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
L52312 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I don't need the money.
L52311 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
L52310 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
L52309 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
L52308 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
L52307 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Right.
L52306 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
L52305 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ We don't have a choice.
L52304 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Forget it!
L52303 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52302 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ And you want to use me to get him?
L52301 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
L52300 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52299 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52298 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ He wants to kill you?
L52297 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because he is trying to retire me.
L52296 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52295 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
L52294 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ So this is something between you and him?
L52293 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
L52292 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Someone hired both of you?
L52291 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Another contractor.
L52290 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Who is that other guy?
L52289 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
L52288 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What does that mean?
L52287 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Until a minute ago.
L52286 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ An assassin?
L52285 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ 'Them'?
L52284 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You're one of them, aren't you?
L52283 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
L52282 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Nikita?
L52281 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You didn't know anything about me.
L52280 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
L52279 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Okay.  How did you find me?
L52251 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
L52250 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You want me to pump?
L52249 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Turn off the engine.
L52248 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Now what?
L52244 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Now you understand why I'm here.
L52243 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Ten million --
L52242 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
L52240 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
L52239 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
L52238 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Twenty large?  That's all?
L52235 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'm part of the game, just like you.
L52234 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
L52233 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah.
L52232 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Bullshit.
L52231 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Yeah?
L52230 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I work for the government.
L52229 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
L52228 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
L52227 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?  How did you know I had a cat?
L52226 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Nikita?  She helped me find you.
L52222 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Where are we going?
L52221 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Get on the expressway.
L52218 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ One hour per man.
L52217 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Um, five.
L52216 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
L52215 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?
L52166 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ A pleasure doing business with you.
L52165 +++$+++ u3800 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Electra --
L52164 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
L52163 +++$+++ u3800 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
L52162 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
L52161 +++$+++ u3800 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
L52160 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I thought it was interesting --
L52159 +++$+++ u3800 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
L52158 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I wasn't watching television.
L52007 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Anytime.
L52006 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Thank you.
L52005 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52004 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Is that all you want?
L52002 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
L52001 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you believe that?
L52000 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Then, I'll sail alone.
L51997 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Can you tell me about it?
L51996 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ All the time.
L51995 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you ever think about starting over?
L51994 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
L51993 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you think about their wives or their families?
L51992 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Sometimes.
L51991 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
L51990 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Everyone regrets something.
L51989 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you ever regret things you've done?
L51987 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Honesty.
L51986 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ For what?
L51983 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I called because I just want... I need to talk.
L51982 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
L51980 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ I think you're supposed to answer that question.
L51979 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You're very good at this aren't you?
L51978 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
L51977 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why are you working today?
L51974 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
L51973 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Would you like a drink?
L51970 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
L51969 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I prefer it like this.
L51967 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.  Please come in.
L51966 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Hi.  Did you call --
L51964 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L51963 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
L51961 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah.
L51960 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
L51959 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah.
L51958 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ You mean quit?
L51957 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why didn't you fade?
L51956 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Anything.
L51955 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Can I ask you a question?
L51954 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
L51953 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Some.
L51952 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
L51951 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
L51950 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ What do other guys do?
L51949 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Go ahead.
L51948 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Can I ask you something?

L51946 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
L51945 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What are you thinking about?
L51944 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
L51943 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Right.
L51942 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
L51941 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Don't know.  That's how it works.
L51939 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ That's exactly what I told myself.
L51938 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
L51937 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ 'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
L51936 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Taken.
L51935 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
L51934 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Shit... oh well.
L51933 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Average.
L51932 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
L51931 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ A dime.
L51930 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
L51929 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's a common question.
L51928 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
L51927 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I hope not.
L51926 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ You're pretty famous aren't you?
L51925 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's possible.
L51924 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I think I've heard of you.
L51922 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
L51921 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why not?
L51920 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
L51919 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Sure.
L51918 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
L51915 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
L51914 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ How much farther?
