L120769 +++$+++ u4350 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
L120738 +++$+++ u4350 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me?
L120737 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
L120734 +++$+++ u4350 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ I can't believe you're doing this.
L120733 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
L120544 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
L120543 +++$+++ u4350 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L120542 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
L120541 +++$+++ u4350 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ What?
L120540 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Look at yours.
L120539 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.
L120538 +++$+++ u4350 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
L120537 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
L120536 +++$+++ u4350 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
L120535 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
L119575 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...he did what he was told.
L119574 +++$+++ u4350 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ Thank you.
L121050 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Yes, you were.
L121049 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
L121048 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I was in the building!
L121047 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ You were in the m- You were in the building.
L121046 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Was I at that dinner?
L121045 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ You were wandering around.
L121044 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Was I at that dinner?
L121043 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ You were wandering around.
L121042 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Was I at that dinner?
L121041 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ You were wandering around.
L121040 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
L121039 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
L121038 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ He's lying.
L121037 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
L121036 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Liar.
L121035 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
L121034 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
L121033 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ That's right.
L121032 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You were never my guest?!
L121031 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
L119696 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Good to see ya.  William would you...
L119695 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
L119694 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hello, Senator.
L119693 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Hi, Ace.
L121115 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I can't do that.
L121114 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
L121113 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
L121112 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
L121111 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
L121110 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ What do you propose?
L121109 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
L121108 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
L121107 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
L121106 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
L121105 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
L121099 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's a pity in this...
L121098 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
L119590 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
L119589 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm serious. No interference.
L119588 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ You got it.
L119587 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
L119586 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
L119585 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But what happens when they do find out?
L119584 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
L119573 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
L119572 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
L119571 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
L119570 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ He even played golf with the President.
L119569 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ Philip, if you would rise.
L119568 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ A powerful man.
L119567 +++$+++ u4369 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STONE +++$+++ This is a very auspicious occasion.
L119566 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
L121880 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Speeding?
L121879 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
L121877 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Hold on a second.
L121876 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hey!
L121875 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Wait, hold on a second.
L121874 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Stop -
L121844 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ All right, take care.
L121843 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay, Randy. Thank you.
L121837 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Congratulations.
L121836 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Yeah.
L121835 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Oh, good.
L121834 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
L121833 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Fine, fine. How's your family?
L121832 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
L121831 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
L121818 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
L121817 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ No, you're not calm.
L121594 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
L121593 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...been right, but who knows?
L121582 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The worst was Blue.
L121581 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Watch it, partner, watch it!
L121580 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...stupid things.
L119853 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
L119852 +++$+++ u4338 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Excuse me.
L119851 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
L121280 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ You got it.  Schmuck.  All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
L121279 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Right back.
L121278 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I'll call you right back.
L121277 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Right away.
L121276 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-

L121274 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
L121273 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
L121272 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
L121269 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
L121268 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
L121267 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
L121266 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Lester...
L121265 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ She's not here, Sam.
L121264 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
L121263 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
L121262 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Hello.
L121261 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hello.
L121249 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Hey, little Dale Evans.
L121248 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
L120586 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
L120585 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You fuckin' piece of shit.
L120584 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Okay.
L120583 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
L120582 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. I know that.
L120581 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
L119843 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
L119842 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Yeah.
L119830 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
L119829 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
L120140 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well...
L120139 +++$+++ u4335 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BANKER +++$+++ No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
L120138 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, sure I do. Why?
L120137 +++$+++ u4335 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BANKER +++$+++ Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
L120135 +++$+++ u4335 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BANKER +++$+++ That's right.
L120134 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
L120133 +++$+++ u4335 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BANKER +++$+++ Now this is just a signature card.
L121657 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Ohhh...
L121656 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I don't know.
L121655 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
L121654 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I don't know.
L121653 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ When did this happen, honey?
L121651 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh, no, please, please.
L121650 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
L121649 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Mommy.
L121648 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
L121647 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Dad!
L121646 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Wh-wh -
L121645 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I can't! I'm tied!
L121644 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Amy! Amy, open the door!
L121643 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Help, Daddy!
L121642 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hello? Hello! Ginger.

L121681 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
L121680 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
L121679 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
L121678 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
L121677 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
L121673 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'll be right there.
L121672 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, she's here.
L121671 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ She's there with you?  She's there with you?
L121670 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
L121669 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
L121668 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well...
L121667 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
L121666 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well...
L121665 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ How'd you know I was here?
L121664 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, I'm not okay.
L121663 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
L121662 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Nick?
L121661 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's me.
L121660 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, uh, who's this?
L121659 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Sammy.
L121658 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hello.
L121338 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
L121337 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
L121336 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
L121335 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
L121334 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
L121331 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
L121330 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ She was afraid to call you.
L121329 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And what'd she want?
L121328 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I just told you. She called me.
L121327 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah.
L121326 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Ginger called me.
L121224 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
L121223 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
L121222 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
L121221 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
L121220 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
L121178 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
L121177 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You never - ?
L121176 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
L121175 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...you? Do you remember what I told you?
L121174 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Back -
L121173 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
L121172 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
L121171 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
L121170 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
L121169 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
L121168 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
L121167 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
L121166 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
L121165 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What are you -
L121164 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
L121163 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I -
L121162 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
L121161 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
L121160 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
L121159 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
L121158 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
L121157 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
L121156 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
L121155 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What people?
L121154 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
L121136 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't ask questions. Just be there.
L121135 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Why?
L121134 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...hundred yards further down the road.
L121133 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, a...
L121132 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What - what, Caesar's?
L121131 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Meet me at three.
L121130 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah.
L120933 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And at the...
L120932 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Practice enough this week, you prick?
L120931 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
L120926 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
L120925 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I see you, you motherfuckers.
L120924 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
L120899 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
L120898 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
L120889 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
L120888 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
L120887 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
L120886 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
L120885 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
L120884 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
L120883 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
L120882 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ That's right, yeah.
L120881 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's none of my business?
L120880 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
L120879 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
L120878 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay?
L120877 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ She came to talk to me...
L120876 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...don't do it to me...
L120875 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...to me.
L120874 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Please...
L120873 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, she came to talk...
L120872 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
L120871 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
L120870 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen, I would -
L120869 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
L120868 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
L120867 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
L120866 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Now, what does she have to do with all this?
L120865 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L120864 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ My wife?
L120863 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
L120862 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah.
L120861 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
L120860 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All right.
L120859 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
L120858 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All right.
L120857 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
L120856 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yes, you lost your control.
L120855 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I lost control?
L120854 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You lost your control.
L120853 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L120852 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What happened to me? What happened to you?
L120851 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
L120850 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
L120849 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah?
L120848 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
L120847 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
L120846 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
L120845 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
L120844 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ That's all taken out of context. Okay.
L120843 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
L120842 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
L120841 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Fine.
L120840 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
L120839 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right, fine.
L120838 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'll be honest with you.
L120837 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Just say so.
L120836 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I don't wanna come along with you.
L120835 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You should say so.
L120834 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, I don't wanna come -
L120833 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
L120832 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
L120831 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
L120830 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
L120829 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
L120828 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
L120827 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You think he got the point?
L120810 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hey.
L120809 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Ace.
L120796 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
L120795 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...very difficult to get in.
L120794 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
L120793 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, no it's okay.
L120787 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Listen...
L120786 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hello.
L120461 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
L120460 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ - no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
L120412 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Rich.
L120411 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
L120327 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
L120326 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
L120325 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ In so many words, yes.
L120324 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ In other words, I'm fucked.
L120323 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
L120322 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
L120321 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Nope, there's no way.
L120320 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
L120318 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
L120317 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
L120316 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
L120315 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
L120255 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right.
L120254 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
L120253 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
L120252 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
L120251 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
L120250 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
L120249 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why, somebody's complaining?
L120248 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
L120244 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Between...
L120243 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
L120224 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
L120223 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
L120219 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Thanks, pal.
L120218 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay.
L120217 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right, Ace?
L120216 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm sorry about this. Really.
L120215 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
L120200 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
L120199 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
L120198 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Then he called me a faggot.
L120197 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What?
L120196 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
L120195 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
L120194 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No.
L120193 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
L120167 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
L120166 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
L120165 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
L120164 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
L120158 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Four aces, Doc.
L120157 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
L120149 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
L120148 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
L120143 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
L120142 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
L120066 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
L120065 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
L119946 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
L119945 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
L119944 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
L119943 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Ohh!
L119908 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
L119907 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
L119903 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
L119902 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
L119901 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
L119900 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
L119899 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You mean, I have your permission?
L119898 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, of course not.
L119897 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
L119896 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
L119889 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Honey, come here.
L119888 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
L119887 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Ginger.
L119886 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L119885 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Somethin', huh?
L119884 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, Sammy.
L119875 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hey.
L119874 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
L119848 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
L119847 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
L119846 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
L119677 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Listen...
L119676 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
L119675 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
L119674 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
L119661 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
L119660 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Eight.
L119659 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
L119651 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ How did Nicky collect?
L119650 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ They payin'?
L119649 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
L119605 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If his girlfriend was knocked up.
L119604 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'll take Columbia for twenty.
L119598 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
L119597 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
L119596 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
L119595 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
L119583 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
L119582 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
L119519 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
L119518 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
L119513 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Matter of fact...
L119512 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
L120674 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ You bet.
L120673 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No problem.  Sorry.
L120672 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
L120671 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
L120670 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
L120669 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
L120668 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
L120667 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
L120666 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
L120665 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
L120664 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
L120663 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
L120662 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
L120661 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
L120657 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, that's quite all right.
L120656 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
L120655 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Oh, thank you, sir.
L120654 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
L120653 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Hey, it is my pleasure.
L120652 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ How do you do?
L120651 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
L119632 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Seven o'clock.
L119631 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Seven o'clock?
L119630 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'll come by.
L119629 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Okay. You come by the house?
L119628 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
L119627 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
L119626 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, that's why they paid so well.
L119625 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
L121526 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
L121525 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hello.
L121120 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
L121119 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
L121118 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
L121117 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
L119891 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Good to meet you.
L119890 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
L119863 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ All right, we're clear.
L119862 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
L119861 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
L119860 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
L119857 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And they were usually right.
L119856 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You go and put your things away.
L119855 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
L119854 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
L121861 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Half - I'm comin' down. 
L121860 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Ace, listen to me.
L121859 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Half of everything is mine.
L121858 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ No, Ace.
L121857 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
L121851 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders-
L121850 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ What can I do?
L121849 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You've got to stop her.
L121848 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ I-I'm sorry, Sam.
L121847 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
L120812 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Yeah, refill'd be great.
L120811 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
L120240 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No. Just stop everything.
L120239 +++$+++ u4368 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STAGE MANAGER +++$+++ It's always been our policy -
L120238 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
L120237 +++$+++ u4368 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STAGE MANAGER +++$+++ But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
L120236 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
L120235 +++$+++ u4368 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STAGE MANAGER +++$+++ ...and she doesn't always -
L120234 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
L120233 +++$+++ u4368 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STAGE MANAGER +++$+++ Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
L120232 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
L120231 +++$+++ u4368 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STAGE MANAGER +++$+++ ...position...
L120230 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I...
L120229 +++$+++ u4368 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STAGE MANAGER +++$+++ ...trying to offer you the respect that your...
L120228 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Why is she eight pounds over?
L120227 +++$+++ u4368 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STAGE MANAGER +++$+++ Well, sir, I was just...
L120226 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
L120225 +++$+++ u4368 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ STAGE MANAGER +++$+++ Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
L121725 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay. 
L121724 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ I-I'll do it.
L121723 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Right away. Okay?
L121722 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ Okay. Just take it easy.
L121721 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
L121720 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ Who's this?
L121719 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
L121201 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
L121200 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
L121199 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
L121198 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Oh, no.
L121197 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ Now, he's really pissed.
L121194 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
L121193 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What is it?

L121383 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
L121382 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.

L121333 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?

L121235 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
L121234 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
L121233 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -

L121127 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
L121126 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
L120700 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
L120699 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
L120698 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No, you don't.
L120697 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yes, I - yes, I do.
L120696 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.

L120694 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I don't need one.
L120693 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
L120692 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay, okay.
L120691 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ If not for me, at least for Amy.
L120690 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L120689 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
L120688 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
L120687 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
L120686 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
L120685 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What? What?!
L120684 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You can't make me stop caring...
L120683 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, how do I know?
L120682 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
L120681 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What?
L120680 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You didn't have to beat him up!
L120679 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
L120678 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I didn't take your pills.
L120677 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
L120676 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Huh?
L120589 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
L120588 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No, he didn't.
L120587 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
L120571 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
L120570 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You can trust me.
L120569 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
L120568 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
L120567 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What are you talkin' a- ?
L120566 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
L120565 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
L120564 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No.
L120563 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
L120561 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
L120560 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
L120559 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
L120558 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
L120557 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Why do you need that much?
L120556 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L120555 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
L120554 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
L120553 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
L120552 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
L120551 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What do you need?
L120550 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay, want to go with Mommy?
L120292 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...they didn't know what really moved her.
L120291 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, fabulous.
L120290 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But as much as they loved her...
L120289 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
L120273 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
L120272 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Hi. Nice to see you.
L120130 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
L120129 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
L120128 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
L120125 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
L120124 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L120123 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
L120122 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
L120121 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
L120120 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
L120119 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
L120118 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
L120115 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh...
L120114 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's nice isn't it?
L120113 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, it's so soft.
L120112 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's chinchilla.
L120111 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You're kidding? My God. What is it?
L120104 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L120103 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Want to go? Let's go back in.
L120102 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah.

L120100 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Uh-huh.

L120096 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L120095 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
L120094 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
L120093 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
L120092 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm not crying. 
L120091 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Why're you crying?
L120090 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L120089 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You all right?
L120064 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
L120063 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
L120062 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
L120061 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
L120060 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
L120059 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Understand?  I'm sorry.
L120058 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I - I - I...
L120057 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

L120055 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
L120054 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
L120053 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
L120052 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
L120051 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You got the wrong girl, Sam.
L120050 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
L120049 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ What, are you trying to handicap me?
L120048 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
L120047 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
L119841 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Good luck.
L119840 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.

L119798 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Any change?

L120534 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
L120533 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ This is not the way to treat people.
L120532 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
L120531 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
L120530 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -
L120529 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ You're firin' me?
L120528 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
L120527 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
L120526 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
L120525 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ I really think you're -
L120524 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
L120523 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
L120522 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
L120521 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
L120520 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
L120519 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
L120518 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
L120517 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
L120516 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
L120515 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
L120309 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
L120308 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
L120307 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
L120306 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
L120305 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ All right, I will, I will.
L120304 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
L120303 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Yeah, okay.
L120302 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
L120301 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Well...
L120300 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
L120299 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Okay, I'll -
L120298 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
L120297 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Loose machines are right back over there.
L119684 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Mr Rothstein.
L119683 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ It won't happen again, Sam.

L120939 +++$+++ u4334 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
L120938 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
L120937 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
L120936 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
L120935 +++$+++ u4334 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ A record of the arrests...
L120934 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...worst possible time for me.
L120038 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
L120037 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ Look what they did to my hand, man!
L120018 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ God! 
L120017 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.

L120013 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Can you do it with your left hand?
L120012 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ No, Sir.
L120011 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Can't do it with both hands?
L120010 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ No.
L120009 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
L120008 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
L119669 +++$+++ u4355 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
L119668 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
L119667 +++$+++ u4355 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
L119666 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Is this yours? Your pen?
L119665 +++$+++ u4355 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L119664 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Excuse me.

'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
L120041 +++$+++ u4374 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WINNER +++$+++ I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
L120040 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
L120039 +++$+++ u4374 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WINNER +++$+++ I just wanna get out of here.

Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?

L120443 +++$+++ u4332 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.

L120730 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
L120729 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
L120728 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
L120727 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ You gotta go back out there.
L120726 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
L120725 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ What expenses?
L120724 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
L120723 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
L120718 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
L120717 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
L120716 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
L120825 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
L120824 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Sam?
L120823 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
L120822 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ You can't talk to me like...
L120821 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
L120820 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
L120819 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
L120818 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
L120817 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
L120816 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Well, I've been busy. 
L120815 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
L120814 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Hi. Good.
L120813 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
L120397 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
L120396 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Yes.
L120395 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
L120394 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
L120393 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
L120392 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
L120391 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
L120390 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Yeah, that works out.

L119940 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.

L121185 +++$+++ u4342 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ DOMINICK +++$+++ Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
L121181 +++$+++ u4342 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ DOMINICK +++$+++ Yeah. Fuck him.
L121180 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.

L121943 +++$+++ u4344 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #10 +++$+++ Stay out of the way!
L121942 +++$+++ u4363 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S WIFE +++$+++ No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!

L121887 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ For what?
L121886 +++$+++ u4345 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
L121567 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
L121566 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I understand.
L121565 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
L121564 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ No problem.
L121563 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
L121562 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ He's good. He's fine.
L121561 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
L121560 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Hm.
L121559 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
L121558 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
L121557 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Are you sure?
L121556 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ No. I ain't see anything like that.
L121555 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
L121554 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
L121553 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
L121552 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
L121551 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I always tell you the truth, Remo.
L121550 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
L121549 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Of course, Remo.
L121548 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
L121547 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Frankie, I want to ask you something.
L120914 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I'll tell him, Remo.
L120913 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
L120912 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I know.
L120911 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ And I mean... that's no good.
L120910 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ What're you gonna do?
L120909 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ It's in all the papers.
L120908 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I know.
L120907 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
L120906 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Yeah, I heard, yeah.
L120905 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
L120488 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
L120487 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I'll take care of it, Remo.
L120486 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ ...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
L120475 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Fine, fine.
L120474 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ How are you?
L120473 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Hey, Frankie.
L120480 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ And how are things going down there?
L120479 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
L120478 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Uh-huh. Good.
L119645 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Want me to take this for you? 
L119644 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Fine.
L119643 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L119642 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
L119641 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right.
L119640 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
L119639 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Mm.
L119638 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
L119637 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Mm.
L119636 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
L119635 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll be right out.
L119634 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
L119624 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
L119623 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Ace.
L119616 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ That's enough now!
L119615 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
L119614 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Ma che cazzo!
L119613 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
L119558 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Definitely the most important guy in this room.
L119557 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ You got a round figure on it?
L121755 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, yeah.

L121750 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
L121749 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Get the fuck out of here.
L121742 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!

L121736 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
L121735 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
L121734 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
L121733 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
L121732 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
L121731 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
L121498 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah. Uh-huh -

L121475 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Everything went to his head.

L121466 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
L121465 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
L121464 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
L121463 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
L121462 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
L121461 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hm.
L121460 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
L121459 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know?
L121458 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L121457 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
L121456 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L121455 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Let me think about that.
L121454 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
L121453 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L121452 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah?
L121451 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
L121450 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I don't - 
L121449 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
L121448 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Nothin'.
L121447 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What? What?
L121446 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
L121445 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
L121317 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Bye.
L121316 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
L121315 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll be there.
L121314 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
L121313 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
L121312 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
L121311 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
L121310 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
L120642 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's all right.
L120641 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Thank you.
L120640 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L120639 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Thanks.
L120638 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
L120637 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You're so nice. 
L120636 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
L120635 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, come on.
L120634 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
L120632 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.  Thanks.
L120631 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right?
L120630 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L120629 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
L120628 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He gives a fuck what I do?
L120627 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
L120626 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
L120625 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
L120624 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
L120623 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I do.
L120622 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
L120621 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I know what you mean.
L120620 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
L120619 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
L120618 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
L120617 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
L120616 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Mm, you want to steal it? 
L120615 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
L120614 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
L120613 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I can see that. Sure.
L120612 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Am I right?
L120611 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Sure.
L120610 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
L120609 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
L120608 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
L120607 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
L120606 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
L120605 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
L120604 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
L120603 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah, no shit.
L120602 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
L120601 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Tell me.
L119895 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, Sammy.
L119894 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Hi, how are you?

L121122 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Great.
L120314 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
L120313 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
L120312 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
L119780 +++$+++ u4351 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ HIGH ROLLER +++$+++ Come on!

L119769 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
L119768 +++$+++ u4351 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ HIGH ROLLER +++$+++ What money? I've seen you stealing from me.

L120374 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
L120373 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.

L120210 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
