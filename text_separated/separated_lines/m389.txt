L287981 +++$+++ u5869 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS +++$+++ I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
L287980 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
L287979 +++$+++ u5869 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS +++$+++ I guess so.
L287978 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
L287977 +++$+++ u5869 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS +++$+++ Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
L287769 +++$+++ u5869 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L287768 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
L287609 +++$+++ u5869 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS +++$+++ The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
L287608 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
L287607 +++$+++ u5869 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS +++$+++ The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
L287553 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
L287552 +++$+++ u5869 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS +++$+++ I think he's dead!
L287551 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
L288051 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Keep trying.
L288050 +++$+++ u5870 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS' VOICE +++$+++ Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
L288049 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You get anything on Smith?
L288048 +++$+++ u5870 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS' VOICE +++$+++ It was stolen.
L288047 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
L288046 +++$+++ u5870 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS' VOICE +++$+++ The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
L288045 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What'd you find out?
L288044 +++$+++ u5870 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ ANDERS' VOICE +++$+++ It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
L288043 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Talley.
L288336 +++$+++ u5871 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BELDONE +++$+++ I'll make the call.
L288335 +++$+++ u5873 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ CASTELLANO +++$+++ I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
L288334 +++$+++ u5871 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BELDONE +++$+++ I understand.
L288333 +++$+++ u5873 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ CASTELLANO +++$+++ Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
L288332 +++$+++ u5871 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BELDONE +++$+++ The best.
L288331 +++$+++ u5873 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ CASTELLANO +++$+++ Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
L288330 +++$+++ u5871 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BELDONE +++$+++ What do you want to do?
L288329 +++$+++ u5873 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ CASTELLANO +++$+++ I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
L288328 +++$+++ u5871 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BELDONE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
L288327 +++$+++ u5873 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ CASTELLANO +++$+++ And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
L288326 +++$+++ u5871 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BELDONE +++$+++ You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.
L288325 +++$+++ u5873 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ CASTELLANO +++$+++ Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
L288324 +++$+++ u5871 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BELDONE +++$+++ The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
L287726 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ It's happening right now.
L287725 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
L287722 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
L287721 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ He knows better than that.
L287720 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
L287719 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ <u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
L287718 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ You should warn them, Sonny.
L287708 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
L287707 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
L287706 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
L287717 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
L287716 +++$+++ u5876 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ FISCHER +++$+++ If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
L287715 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
L287712 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
L287711 +++$+++ u5876 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ FISCHER +++$+++ I guess not.
L287710 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ You think we should take that chance?
L287709 +++$+++ u5876 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ FISCHER +++$+++ Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
L287605 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
L287604 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ <u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
L287603 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
L287602 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Bullshit!
L287601 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You won't die if you let me help.
L287600 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
L287595 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
L287594 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ <u>Get on the floor</u>!
L287591 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
L287590 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm going to my desk.
L287589 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
L287514 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
L287513 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ The car.  All you want is the car?
L287512 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
L287511 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Who sent you?
L287509 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
L287508 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Jen?  Are you all right?
L288179 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I'm not going to die for this!
L288178 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Then we might as well die rich.
L288177 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
L288176 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
L288175 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It's over.  We have to give up.
L288174 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
L288173 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
L288172 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
L288171 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L288170 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
L288092 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
L288091 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
L288090 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ There is no way out.
L288089 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
L288088 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We're fucked.
L287856 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
L287855 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
L287853 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Like what?
L287852 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Not if they're looking at something else.
L287851 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
L287850 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
L287849 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
L287848 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
L287786 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
L287785 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
L287666 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
L287665 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Jesus.  What is this?
L287663 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
L287662 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
L287661 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
L287660 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
L287659 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It's about Mars --
L287658 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
L287657 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I have to tell you something --
L287583 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
L287582 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
L287581 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
L287485 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
L287484 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We're on foot.  We can't get away.
L287483 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
L287481 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
L287480 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
L287479 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That woman's gonna call the cops.
L287474 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
L287473 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ There's fuckin' blood all over you!
L287466 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
L287465 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
L287464 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
L287463 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
L287462 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
L287460 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
L287459 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
L288123 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
L288122 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ It ain't been a good day, Chief.
L288120 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
L288119 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Give up.
L288118 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
L288117 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
L288114 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
L288113 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
L288112 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
L288111 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
L288110 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
L288109 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
L288019 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
L288018 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
L288017 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
L288016 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
L288015 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Let me come get him.
L288014 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Okay.
L288013 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
L288003 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
L288002 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We been through that.  Forget it.
L288001 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
L288000 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
L287999 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
L287998 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ That you, Talley?
L287888 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
L287887 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You're a funny guy, Talley.
L287886 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I gotta piss real bad.
L287885 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ What?
L287884 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
L287883 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
L287882 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I'll give you these people.
L287881 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
L287880 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
L287879 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm here.
L287878 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Talley?
L287874 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
L287873 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
L287654 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
L287653 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
L287652 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
L287651 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
L287650 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ How about the cop?
L287649 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
L287648 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
L287647 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
L287646 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ They're fine.
L287645 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
L287644 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
L287643 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
L287642 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We're cool.
L287641 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
L287640 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
L287639 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
L287638 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You with the cops?
L287906 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
L287905 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ <u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
L287904 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
L287903 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What about my father?
L287791 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I'm getting a doctor!
L287790 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Use more ice.
L287789 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
L287788 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
L287787 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
L287624 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
L287623 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He needs a doctor.
L287506 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ My father.
L287505 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Who else is here?
L288252 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
L288251 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ I don't know.
L288250 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ <u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
L288249 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ I overheard him with the girl.
L288248 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
L288184 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuckin' A.
L288183 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
L288182 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You got something to say?
L288095 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Dennis.
L288094 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
L287902 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ They'll cut the power.
L287901 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ What the fuck is that?
L287862 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We don't have time!
L287861 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ I got the gasoline --
L287860 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ The cops are comin'!
L287797 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
L287796 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
L287795 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
L287781 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ You can't run with suitcases.
L287780 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We can take it with us.
L287779 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ We're trapped in a house.
L287778 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
L287777 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
L287767 +++$+++ u5875 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DILL +++$+++ Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
L287766 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You have his address?
L287765 +++$+++ u5875 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DILL +++$+++ Keeps to himself, more like.
L287764 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
L287763 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
L287762 +++$+++ u5875 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DILL +++$+++ That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
L287761 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Can you identify this man?
L288368 +++$+++ u5885 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You fucked up, Glen.
L288367 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Are you out of your mind?
L287753 +++$+++ u5885 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I don't eat junk food.
L287752 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Donuts here any good?
L287749 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
L287748 +++$+++ u5885 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Okey-doke.
L287747 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
L287746 +++$+++ u5885 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ It won't be a problem.
L287745 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
L288059 +++$+++ u5890 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ SEYMORE +++$+++ Canyon Country.
L288058 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ What hospital?
L288057 +++$+++ u5890 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ SEYMORE +++$+++ <u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
L288056 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
L288055 +++$+++ u5890 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ SEYMORE +++$+++ I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
L287744 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
L287743 +++$+++ u5890 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ SEYMORE +++$+++ If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
L287742 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L287741 +++$+++ u5890 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ SEYMORE +++$+++ What if it goes south?
L287729 +++$+++ u5890 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ SEYMORE +++$+++ An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
L287728 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Give me an ETA.
L287727 +++$+++ u5890 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ SEYMORE +++$+++ L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
L288364 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ You'd better be kidding.
L288363 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
L288360 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
L288359 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
L288356 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
L288355 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ All right.  Now the second one.
L288353 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Close.
L288352 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Where is it?
L288351 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
L288346 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You said they would be here!
L288345 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
L288344 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
L288343 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
L288323 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
L288322 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L288321 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
L288320 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I think you got no choice.
L288319 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
L288318 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
L288317 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ What do you want?
L288316 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
L288315 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
L288314 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
L288313 +++$+++ u5877 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ HOWELL +++$+++ How did you get this number?
L287699 +++$+++ u5878 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ That's okay.  I love you anyway.
L287698 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm scared shitless.
L287696 +++$+++ u5878 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
L287695 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
L287694 +++$+++ u5878 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You sure?
L287693 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
L287691 +++$+++ u5878 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
L287690 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
L287689 +++$+++ u5878 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
L287688 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
L287537 +++$+++ u5878 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ We'll see you in a couple of hours.
L287536 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Can we talk some more when you get here?
L287529 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I still see that boy's eyes.
L287528 +++$+++ u5878 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
L287527 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I need to work out some stuff.
L288280 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I know.
L288279 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
L287834 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
L287833 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Shh, they'll hear you!
L287832 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You leave that gun alone!
L287830 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
L287829 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I'm not gonna leave you!
L287828 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
L287827 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ We can't carry him.
L287826 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
L287825 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
L287824 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Mine, too.
L287823 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ That big asshole nailed my windows.
L287822 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No one's coming.
L287821 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Be quiet!  Listen!
L287820 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Ow!  Shit!
L288260 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Stop it.
L288259 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Now we can do whatever we want.
L288258 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
L288257 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
L288255 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L288254 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Kevin left without you.
L287993 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How about dog shit?
L287992 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
L287991 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
L287990 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What?
L287989 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ We can't make the microwave work.
L287988 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What do you want?
L287635 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What I want is to help my father.
L287634 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
L287633 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't drink beer.
L287632 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Want one?
L288193 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yes.
L288192 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
L288191 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How can we get out?
L288190 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
L288189 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I can't go without Thomas.
L288188 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
L288187 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What happened?
L288186 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
L288185 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What do you want?
L287807 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
L287806 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
L287805 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
L287804 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Whatever.
L287803 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Thanks for the shirt.
L287802 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
L287801 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
L287800 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You gotta pee?
L287630 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Mars?  What are you doing?
L287629 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Please get away from me.
L288138 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
L288137 +++$+++ u5880 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JORGENSON +++$+++ What's going on?
L287556 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Keep your head down.
L287555 +++$+++ u5880 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JORGENSON +++$+++ What are we going to do about Mike?
L287554 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
L287550 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Holster your guns!
L287549 +++$+++ u5880 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JORGENSON +++$+++ He said something about a girl --
L287548 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Are civilians inside?
L288156 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Another minute.  Please --
L288155 +++$+++ u5882 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KLAUS +++$+++ That's enough.
L288151 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I need to talk to him.  Alone.
L288150 +++$+++ u5882 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KLAUS +++$+++ Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
L288149 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
L288041 +++$+++ u5882 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KLAUS +++$+++ He.  Can't.  Answer.
L288040 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Just one question.  Please.
L288039 +++$+++ u5882 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KLAUS +++$+++ I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
L288034 +++$+++ u5882 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KLAUS +++$+++ What are you doing?!  Stop that!
L288033 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Smith!  Wake up!
L288032 +++$+++ u5882 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KLAUS +++$+++ Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
L288031 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
L287916 +++$+++ u5883 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
L287915 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
L287914 +++$+++ u5883 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
L287913 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Is something wrong with Jane?
L287580 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
L287579 +++$+++ u5883 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ What's that, Chief?  Say again.
L287578 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ That's not enough.
L287544 +++$+++ u5883 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
L287543 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Where are they?
L287542 +++$+++ u5883 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
L287541 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
L287912 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Stand by.
L287911 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
L287910 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What's wrong with the radio?
L287909 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
L287908 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Did you find Jane and Mandy?
L287899 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
L287898 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ She didn't answer.
L287897 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You have her cell number?
L287896 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
L287895 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Go.
L287894 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ Chief, base.
L287775 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Tell her I'm almost home.
L287774 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ I know the one.
L287773 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
L287772 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ Go, Chief.
L287771 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Louise?
L287612 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Get a phone number for the Smiths.
L287611 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ Go, Chief.
L287610 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Louise?
L287577 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
L287576 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
L287575 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
L287570 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
L287569 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ He didn't say.
L287568 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Did he say if she was shooting at him?
L287567 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
L287562 +++$+++ u5884 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ LOUISE'S VOICE +++$+++ Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
L287561 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
L288236 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Goddamned small town bullshit.
L288235 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Let it go, Captain.
L288084 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
L288083 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
L288082 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
L288081 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
L288080 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I want to know what in hell you're doing.
L287985 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
L287984 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
L287940 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
L287939 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You want me to stick around, I could --
L287938 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
L287937 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
L287936 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
L287935 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
L287934 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
L287933 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ He says that his father's hurt.
L287893 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
L287892 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
L287891 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
L287890 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
L287889 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
L287870 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Order your men to stand down.
L287869 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
L287844 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Maddox!  You got that?
L287843 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
L287842 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Sounds like you know the job.
L287841 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
L287840 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Do it.
L287836 +++$+++ u5887 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
L287835 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
L288243 +++$+++ u5888 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MIKKELSON'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L288242 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
L288239 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Go, Mickey.
L288238 +++$+++ u5888 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MIKKELSON'S VOICE +++$+++ Chief, it's Mikkelson.
L288237 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ It's mine.  Talley.
L287616 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
L287615 +++$+++ u5888 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MIKKELSON'S VOICE +++$+++ The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
L287614 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Go, Mickey.
L287613 +++$+++ u5888 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MIKKELSON'S VOICE +++$+++ Chief, Mikkelson.
L287574 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
L287573 +++$+++ u5888 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MIKKELSON'S VOICE +++$+++ It's right in front of us.
L287572 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
L287571 +++$+++ u5888 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MIKKELSON'S VOICE +++$+++ We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
L288294 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
L288293 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Where's the office?
L288292 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The kids are in here!
L288286 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ They've been in there all day.
L288285 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
L288284 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Not until the man calls.
L288283 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We've got to get those kids out of there!
L288219 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
L288218 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
L288217 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What are you people going to do?
L288216 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
L288215 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Special Agent Jones.
L288214 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
L288213 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What?
L288212 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ What's my name?
L288211 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
L288210 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Don't worry about what we used to be.
L288209 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
L288208 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
L288207 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
L288206 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Are all of you named Jones?
L288205 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
L288299 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ No!  They're right here --
L288298 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Are the disks still in your room?
L288132 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
L288131 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Who is it?
L288130 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
L288129 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
L288128 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
L288127 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
L288126 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
L288125 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Can you open them?
L288079 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L288078 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
L288077 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
L288076 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Can you get into the office?
L288075 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
L288074 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I thought they locked you in your room.
L288073 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
L288072 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
L288071 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
L288070 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ He has lots of disks.
L288069 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
L288068 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L288067 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
L288066 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Okay.
L288065 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
L288064 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I think so.
L288063 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
L288062 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Is my daddy okay?
L287930 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
L287929 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
L287928 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
L287927 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
L287926 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ In my room.
L287925 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Where are you right now?
L287924 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ We're okay.
L287923 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ How about you and your sister?
L287922 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
L287921 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
L287920 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
L287919 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
L288310 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ How do I reach him?
L288309 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
L288308 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
L288307 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
L288306 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Yes.
L288305 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Did you find the disks?
L288154 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
L288153 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L288148 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ They're still in the house.
L288147 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Where are my children?
L287969 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Smith will know.
L287968 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ These disks . . . where are they?
L287967 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
L287966 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You want . . . Marlon and Al.
L287965 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
L287964 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
L287963 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
L287962 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
L287961 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Marlon and Al....
L287959 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You can let go.
L287958 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
L287953 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
L287952 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What do you want?
L287951 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
L287949 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
L287948 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Who are you?
L287947 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
L287946 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Where's your gun?
L288167 +++$+++ u5893 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
L288166 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
L288165 +++$+++ u5893 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
L288164 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Your phony FBI assholes.
