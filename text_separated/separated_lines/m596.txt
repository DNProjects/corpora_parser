L642514 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Where's the camera?
L642508 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
L642507 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Stop this, stop this.
L642450 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ Yes, yes.
L642449 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
L642439 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ You'd like me to kill them?
L642438 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
L642247 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
L642246 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
L642245 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Give them to Refugio.
L642244 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ No, the children sleep with me.
L642243 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ I'll come to you tonight.
L642537 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
L642536 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Take me there.
L642535 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ That one.
L642534 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Which couch?
L642533 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ They're playing games behind the couch ...
L642532 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ What about them?
L642531 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Enedina and Paco ...
L642530 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ What's that?
L642529 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Don Amalio!
L642487 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
L642486 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
L642296 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
L642295 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
L642199 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
L642198 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
L642143 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Then it's a respectable house.
L642142 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
L642141 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Are there many windows?
L642140 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Two.
L642139 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
L642065 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Then you won't forgive me?
L642064 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
L642063 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
L642062 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
L642061 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You must listen to me before you go.
L642060 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Let me pass!
L642051 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Go away! Leave me alone.
L642050 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
L642047 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
L642046 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You're lying.
L642036 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Don't go!
L642035 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Leave us alone, Ramona.
L641999 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
L641998 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
L641990 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Maybe ...
L641989 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
L641988 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Unfortunately ...
L641987 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
L641986 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
L641984 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
L641983 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Wasn't that cowardice?
L641982 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
L641981 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
L641980 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You must think I'm mad.
L641977 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
L641976 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
L641972 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Today I can refuse you nothing.
L641971 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
L641970 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Whatever you like.
L641969 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
L641968 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Thank you, Uncle.
L641967 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
L641966 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
L641965 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
L641936 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No, but what a pity life is like that.
L641935 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You must think I am a monster.
L641934 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
L641933 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ And this innocent child.
L641932 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
L641930 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
L641929 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Evil.
L641928 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
L641927 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ How could anybody behave like that?
L641926 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Never.
L641925 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Don't you ever see him?
L641924 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L641923 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
L641922 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ How did you know about that?
L641918 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Nothing. I didn't say anything.
L641917 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ What do you mean?
L641916 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Only because you want it.
L641915 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
L641914 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
L641885 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You see, even the voice.
L641884 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
L641883 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
L641882 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Come down.
L641881 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
L641880 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Who is she?
L641879 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Come down here, you scamp.
L641877 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
L641876 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
L641873 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No.
L641872 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You have no feelings toward ...
L641871 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
L641870 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
L641869 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No. Mother Superior told me to come.
L641868 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Was that difficult to get?
L641867 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
L641866 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ How long are you staying?
L641865 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You'll think you're still at the convent.
L641864 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
L641863 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
L641862 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Yes, Uncle. How are you?
L642069 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
L642068 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
L642067 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L642066 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You believe me, don't you?
L642057 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
L642056 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ But what can I say to her, sir?
L642055 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
L642054 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
L642053 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
L641954 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
L641953 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
L641952 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
L641951 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
L641950 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
L641949 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
L641948 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ What's the matter?
L641947 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
L641944 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
L641943 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
L641889 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Yes, sir. Good night.
L641888 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Leave me now. You can go to bed.
L642548 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
L642547 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
L642513 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
L642512 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ Yes.
L642511 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Is it all right?
L642447 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
L642446 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ She won't even know.
L642445 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ What will the lady say?
L642384 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
L642383 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
L642382 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
L642327 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ That's good land.
L642326 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ And in the vegetable plot?
L642325 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
L642324 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
L642323 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
L642306 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Good.
L642305 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ That's it.
L642304 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ That's fifteen by seven?
L642303 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ Fifteen yards.
L642302 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ How much is that?
L642566 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
L642565 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Ramona! Ramona!
L642557 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ But why? Why?
L642556 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ He was asking for it.
L642555 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ My God, what have you done to him!
L642301 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ That doesn't matter; I like it.
L642300 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ Thank you; but it's missing something.
L642299 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ It's very good.
L642279 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
L642278 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
L642277 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
L642276 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Me?
L642379 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
L642378 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ You see how much you like her?
L642377 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
L642376 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ I think I'd better go tomorrow.
L642375 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ How in hell does it wind up?
L642372 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
L642371 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ She isn't my cousin.
L642370 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ That your cousin is more to your taste.
L642369 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What are you thinking about?
L642368 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
L642367 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
L642366 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
L642365 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ You're happy, aren't you!
L642364 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
L642363 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L642362 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ If you wake first, wake me up.
L642195 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
L642194 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ So, Ramona!
L642190 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
L642189 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
L642188 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ She's mad.
L642187 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
L642186 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ Why the bad temper?
L642185 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Nothing.
L642184 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L642130 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
L642129 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
L642578 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
L642577 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Kill him.
L642576 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
L642575 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Where's the dough?
L642574 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
L642572 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
L642571 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Me, rich? Come on!
L642570 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
L642569 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
L642426 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
L642425 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I don't know -- they've always been there.
L642423 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
L642422 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ You wouldn't be here otherwise.
L642421 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Why?
L642420 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
L642418 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
L642417 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ And this chest?
L642128 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
L642127 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I don't know, sir.
L642126 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Why did he kill himself?
L642125 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ He was very good. Better than some people would think.
L642406 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Why?
L642405 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ No.
L642404 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Is she coming back?
L642403 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ She's left.
L642402 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ And ...your friend?
L642401 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
L642400 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Yes. Why?
L642399 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Do you intend to stay here for some time?
L642398 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'll be ready.
L642397 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
L642396 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
L642395 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Are they going to work here too?
L642339 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
L642338 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
L642337 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
L642336 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
L642335 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
L642334 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Do they worry you that much, then?
L642333 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
L642332 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Leave him alone.
L642331 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What are you doing here? Get out.
L642263 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm not like you, you have your wife.
L642262 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
L642261 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
L642260 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I know that you used to work with an architect.
L642259 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What do you know about me?
L642256 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
L642255 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ But you have a right to let us know what you think.
L642254 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
L642252 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
L642251 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Well... is it so urgent?
L642250 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
L642249 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
L642153 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
L642152 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
L642151 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Are you Jorge?
L642150 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Miss Viridiana ...
L642321 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ Canelo!
L642320 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What's he called?
L642319 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
L642316 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
L642315 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ How much do you want for him?
L642314 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
L642312 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ And let him get run over by somebody else?
L642311 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Then let him go and he'll follow you.
L642310 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ It's for people!
L642358 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ He's lying through his ass!
L642357 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Stop this!
L642356 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ You'll soon find out, you liar!
L642354 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
L642353 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Don't say that.
L642352 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
L642351 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Are your parents alive?
L642348 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
L642347 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Things seem to be getting better.
L642346 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ How are you today?
L642234 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
L642233 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
L642231 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ They told me it isn't at the hospital.
L642230 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Are you sure it isn't contagious?
L642229 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
L642083 +++$+++ u8789 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Come with me.
L642082 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Where?
L642081 +++$+++ u8789 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ There's been an accident.
L642080 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Why not?
L642079 +++$+++ u8789 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ You cannot leave ...
L642078 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
L642077 +++$+++ u8789 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
L642086 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
L642085 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
L642014 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ You little liar! Get out of here!
L642013 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ He came in through the cupboard.
L642011 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ He couldn't get through the door, then?
L642010 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Yes -- very, very big!
L642009 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ Very, very?
L642008 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ It's a very big one.
L642007 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ A black bull!
L642006 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ A black bull came.
L642005 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ Don't invent stories; go to bed.
L642004 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ I'm afraid.
L642003 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ Why are you crying?
L642411 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
L642410 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ Yes!
L642409 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You have decided to leave, Moncho.
L642170 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ But, miss ...
L642169 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
L642163 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ This louse is looking for trouble.
L642162 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ What's going on, Moncho?
L642145 +++$+++ u8790 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MONCHO +++$+++ They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
L642144 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
L642108 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You are forgiven. Goodbye.
L642107 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Forgive me if I have offended you.
L642102 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
L642101 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
L642100 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
L642095 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
L642094 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I had so many things to think about!
L642093 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
L642091 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Mother.
L642090 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
L641852 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
L641851 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
L641850 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
L641849 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
L641848 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
L641847 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
L641846 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
L641845 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
L641843 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ All right, Mother.
L641842 +++$+++ u8791 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
L641841 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Mother?
L642175 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
L642174 +++$+++ u8793 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PELON +++$+++ I've had a gutful of this.
L642173 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
L642166 +++$+++ u8793 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PELON +++$+++ I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
L642165 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Don't talk like that!
L642117 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Good, then let's go!
L642116 +++$+++ u8793 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PELON +++$+++ When you are, miss.
L642115 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
L642360 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
L642359 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Ask the priest, miss.
L642273 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
L642272 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ She looks like a sick marrow!
L642222 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
L642221 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ I'm only good at making people laugh.
L642220 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ What about you, Manuel?
L642119 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
L642118 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
L642034 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
L642033 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Have I slept long?
L642032 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
L642031 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ What happened to me?
L642030 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ That will soon pass. It's nothing.
L642029 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I have a headache.
L642028 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ How do you feel?
L641860 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Ah! Pleased to meet you.
L641859 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
L641911 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ No, I don't want to.
L641910 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
L641909 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
L641908 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ From the terrace.
L641907 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ How did you see me?
L641904 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Yes, yes, I saw you!
L641903 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ What?
L641893 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
L641892 +++$+++ u8796 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Today, a good girl.
