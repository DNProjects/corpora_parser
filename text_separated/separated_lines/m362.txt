L227204 +++$+++ u5444 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
L227203 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ But she might be in trouble...
L227202 +++$+++ u5444 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
L227201 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Have you seen Tamara?
L227200 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Jason...Voorhees?
L227199 +++$+++ u5444 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
L227198 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
L227073 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ But...wait a minute!
L227072 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
L227071 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Time to check out the waiters.
L227070 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Yeah.
L227069 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ That was truly excellent.
L227055 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
L227054 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L227044 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
L227043 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
L227042 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
L227036 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
L227035 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ I guess not.
L227034 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
L227033 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
L227032 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
L227031 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ No thanks.
L227024 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ You're joking, right?
L227023 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
L227022 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
L227020 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
L227019 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
L227018 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
L226947 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Improvise, of course.
L226946 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L226945 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ A major prick.
L226934 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ More or less. It's part of my college fund.
L226933 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ He bought you that?
L226932 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
L226931 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
L226930 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Really?
L226929 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
L226891 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ No.
L226890 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
L226889 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ And you'll never do it again.
L226888 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
L226881 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hear what?
L226880 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Did you hear that?
L226878 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
L226877 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Right.
L226876 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
L226875 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Right.
L226860 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
L226859 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Tell me.
L226858 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
L226857 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ What murders?
L226854 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nothing.
L226853 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ What's wrong?
L226849 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Ask me in about five minutes.
L226848 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well...how do you feel?
L227357 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous!
L227356 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Jason's here in New York.
L227292 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ We have to get off this ship!!
L227291 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Dear Christ...
L227286 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Not another word, do you hear me??
L227285 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ This is Jason's fault!
L227284 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
L227246 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ The fire alarm...
L227245 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ What's that?
L227196 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
L227195 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
L227194 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Christ...where's Rennie??
L227177 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's...dead.
L227176 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Where's the radio?
L226905 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
L226904 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ But I thought...
L226903 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Rennie's not coming.
L226902 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
L227103 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
L227102 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
L227101 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ I packed it. Just for us.
L227100 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Where did you get that alcohol?
L227053 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
L227052 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ They're out of town.
L227051 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
L227048 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Nothing.
L227047 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ What are you doing in here?
L226944 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Perfectly.
L226943 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
L227334 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
L227333 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ I don't think that's such a safe idea
L227332 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
L227317 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
L227316 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ There must be a phone around here somewhere.
L227282 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
L227281 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ What did you do with Rennie??
L227253 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
L227252 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L227251 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I doubt very much that one even exists.
L227242 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
L227241 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ He's doing the best he can, Charles.
L227240 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
L227239 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Did you find Rennie?
L227189 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Walking corpses are not real!
L227188 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
L227187 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
L227186 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ What are you doing??
L227175 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Oh dear God...
L227174 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I demand to know what is going on...
L227136 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Where is she?
L227135 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I thought I told you to stay away from her.
L227092 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
L227091 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
L226958 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ No, I think it's just the beginning.
L226957 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
L226956 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
L226955 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
L226954 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
L226953 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You have no right...
L226952 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
L226951 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
L226950 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
L226949 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
L226948 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
L227385 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
L227384 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ I...I can't...
L227382 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Am I? Let's find out.
L227381 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ You're telling a lie.
L227380 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
L227379 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ He is not.
L227378 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
L227375 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
L227374 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
L227373 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
L227372 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ What a beautiful day.
L227388 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
L227387 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ You pushed me...
L227297 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You can and you will!!
L227296 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I...I can't...
L227295 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Get in the boat, Rennie!
L227228 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ This isn't a request.
L227227 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
L227226 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
L227225 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
L227224 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
L227223 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Can't we at least talk about it?
L227217 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
L227216 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ But Sean said...
L227215 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You had me worried to death!
L227002 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I'm staying.
L227001 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
L227000 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
L226999 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Why are you doing this to yourself?
L226998 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ She didn't push me into coming.
L226997 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
L226996 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I'm staying.
L226995 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
L227089 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
L227088 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
L227087 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Did you have an accident in the lake?
L227086 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ After your parents passed away?
L227085 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
L227084 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ When did this start?
L227083 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
L227082 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
L227081 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ It's not that simple.
L227080 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
L227079 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ I gathered that.
L227078 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I can't swim.
L227064 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ There's something I haven't told you...
L227063 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
L227062 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Yeah...a lot.
L227061 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ So, are you having fun yet?
L227060 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
L227059 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Have you seen my dog anywhere?
L227058 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
L226922 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
L226921 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I don't know what to say...
L226920 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
L226917 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
L226916 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
L226915 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Really?
L226914 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
L226913 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Just felt a little chill.
L226912 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Everything okay?
L226911 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ What about not-so-great writers?
L226910 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
L226909 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
L226908 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ I'm glad you decided to come after all.
L227172 +++$+++ u5439 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RADIO OFFICER +++$+++ Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
L227171 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I've got the numbers.
L227170 +++$+++ u5439 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RADIO OFFICER +++$+++ The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
L227169 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yes...
L227168 +++$+++ u5439 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RADIO OFFICER +++$+++ Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
L227167 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I...I don't know...
L227166 +++$+++ u5439 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RADIO OFFICER +++$+++ What is your location?
L227165 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
L227409 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Please, hurry...
L227408 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You have to call the police...
L227349 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
L227348 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Rennie...what'd they do to you??
L227275 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I'm not!!
L227274 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ But Rennie...
L227273 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I'm not going near any lifeboat!
L227272 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
L227269 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Is the ship going to sink??
L227268 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
L227263 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ The window...
L227262 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Rennie...??
L227155 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Just radio for help, okay???
L227154 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I didn't mean for you to go!
L227153 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
L227152 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Where are they?
L227151 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
L227148 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ What do you mean???
L227147 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
L227130 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
L227129 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ What about you?
L227128 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
L227127 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Can he really take us home?
L227118 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I want to go home. I want off this ship.
L227117 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's okay...you're going to be okay.
L226991 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I'd love to.
L226990 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
L226988 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
L226987 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ But I didn't get you one...
L226986 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I got you a present.
L226985 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ We changed our minds.
L226984 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I heard you weren't coming.
L226983 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Hi, Sean.
L226982 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Rennie...
