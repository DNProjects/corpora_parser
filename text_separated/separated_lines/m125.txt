L381602 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ And if I say yes?
L381601 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
L381598 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
L381597 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
L381591 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ I gotta be honest about something.
L381590 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ No. just peace on Earth.
L381589 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ And Goodwill Toward Man?
L381588 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
L381576 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You got smeared.
L381575 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ I guess I lost:
L381574 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
L381573 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ What the hell...
L381572 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ ...touch that.
L381567 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's not even a fucking door.
L381566 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
L381565 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
L381564 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
L381558 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
L381557 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
L381556 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cowan--
L381555 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
L381554 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cowan--
L381553 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
L381549 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
L381548 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
L381547 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ The hell were you thinking?
L381546 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
L381545 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You shot an eight year old girl.
L381544 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
L381543 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Hesitated, sir.
L381542 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ The hell happened?
L381643 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
L381642 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ It'll make sense later?
L381641 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
L381640 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
L381634 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
L381633 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
L381632 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
L381630 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
L381629 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
L381606 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L381605 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
L381600 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ What happens if I say no?
L381599 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Only the damn guy won't know it.
L381594 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Mrs. Edelson?
L381593 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
L381592 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ You think we're nuts.
L381538 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ We're the government, Cowan.
L381537 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
L381536 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
L381535 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
L381521 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
L381520 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
L381513 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
L381512 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ They don't?
L381511 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
L381510 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ ... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
L381505 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
L381504 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ You do?
L381503 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ All the time, sir.
L381502 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
L381501 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Actually, sir--
L381500 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
L381499 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
L381498 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Well this didn't.
L381497 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
L381496 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Actually, it didn't come from me.
L381495 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
L381494 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
L382055 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Kay...
L382054 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
L382020 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
L382019 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
L382018 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ 'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
L381475 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yup.  Sure is.
L381474 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Helluva night, isn't it?
L381464 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L381463 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
L381462 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
L381461 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
L381460 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I wasn't scared...
L381457 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
L381456 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
L381439 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.
L381438 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Kay, I'm sorry...
L381437 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
L381433 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What?  I thought you just--
L381432 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
L381431 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
L381406 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?
L381405 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ I'd go with number three.
L381404 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Which do you have your money on, Dee?
L381455 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You heard me.  You two, especially.
L381454 +++$+++ u1903 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ INS LEADER +++$+++ What?
L381453 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
L381447 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
L381446 +++$+++ u1903 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ INS LEADER +++$+++ Why?  What are you gonna do?
L381445 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
L381415 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
L381414 +++$+++ u1903 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ INS LEADER +++$+++ Sir, you can't just--
L381413 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
L381412 +++$+++ u1903 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ INS LEADER +++$+++ Sir--
L381411 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Vayanse. You others, go on.
L381402 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ INS, Washington.  Special services.
L381401 +++$+++ u1903 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ INS LEADER +++$+++ What?  Who the hell are you?
L381400 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We'll take it from here.
L382278 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
L382277 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
L382276 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay, you're scaring your partner.
L382275 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
L382274 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
L382270 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ There wasn't time, sport!
L382269 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You coulda told me what you were doing.
L382268 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
L382267 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ After I got the shit beat out of me!
L382266 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
L382265 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You were saying?
L382217 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay!?
L382216 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
L382152 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ In case I need it.
L382151 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ in case I need it?
L382150 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
L382149 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
L382148 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Right.  Oh, and here.
L382147 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Do his job.
L382146 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
L382136 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'd double it and add 20.
L382135 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Would you call this a code 100?
L382120 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ All of it?
L382119 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's marble.
L382114 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
L382113 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
L382112 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ For how long?
L382111 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
L382103 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Since as long as we've been keeping records...
L382102 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Since how long?
L382045 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
L382044 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L382040 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
L382039 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
L382038 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
L382037 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
L382036 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay.  All I'm saying--
L382035 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
L382034 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
L382033 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ How does that help me?
L382032 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
L382031 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ He's here to help!?
L382028 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
L382027 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay--
L382016 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
L382015 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What if he's telling the truth?
L382014 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
L382000 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
L381999 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ "Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
L381945 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ The Pentagon.
L381944 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
L381926 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We're rising.
L381925 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Jesus Christ...
L381924 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Get back in the car!
L381923 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Jesus...
L381919 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
L381918 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
L381900 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I think that's what's happening...
L381899 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You think that's what's-happening?
L381898 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
L381897 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ The radio show?
L381896 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
L381895 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What's going on, Kay?
L381873 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Where to?
L381872 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Looks like a train ticket.
L381871 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What?
L381870 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ And what's this ... ?
L381869 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
L381868 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
L381867 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
L381866 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Gee.  You really think?
L381865 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Something's wrong here.
L381831 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ There's a god damn good reason.
L381830 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
L381829 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
L381802 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Hold it.
L381801 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
L381800 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
L381796 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
L381795 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Now what?
L381792 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ A what?
L381791 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
L381790 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
L381789 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
L381787 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
L381786 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ what's this?
L381776 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Let's check am out.
L381775 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
L381774 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
L381773 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
L381772 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Something seem unusual to you about that?
L381771 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What?
L381749 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
L381748 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
L381747 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Um-- Kay?
L381746 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You don't know me at all.
L381745 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
L381744 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Why?
L381743 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
L381741 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It was a long time ago.-
L381740 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Ha ha.  No, really.
L381739 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I taught kindergarten.
L381738 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
L381737 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You don't know the half of it.
L381736 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
L381735 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
L381734 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
L381733 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
L381732 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
L381731 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
L381730 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
L381729 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ She didn't even know you. .
L381728 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
L381694 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
L381693 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Keep her out of here while I check it out.
L381692 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
L381668 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
L381667 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I know, but we're on a college campus...
L381666 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
L381665 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
L381660 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
L381659 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L381658 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
L381655 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
L381654 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Right.
L381653 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ It's a bug.
L381650 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
L381649 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
L381648 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
L381647 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We wear black.
L381646 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
L382030 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
L382029 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
L382022 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
L382021 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Sure.
L382013 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You know, there's something we never really thought of...
L382012 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
L381938 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
L381937 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
L381936 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
L382236 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
L382235 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yeah ... ?
L382234 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ They respond to fear, right?
L382233 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What are you doing?
L382230 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Are you sure you don't?
L382229 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
L382228 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
L382227 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
L382189 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Out of focus?
L382188 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
L382157 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Actually... I don't know.
L382156 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What the hell does that mean?
L382155 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What do we do?    Lean into it.
L382154 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What do we do?
L382110 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ So... how did they get here?
L382109 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
L382108 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ When?
L382099 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
L382098 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
L382097 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
L382096 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What is it?
L382095 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
L382075 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
L382074 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Why not?
L382073 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
L382072 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
L382071 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
L382068 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Actually, you may have.
L382067 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
L381710 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Do have any idea what I just said?
L381709 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
L381708 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
L381707 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Right, right-- I like that stuff.
L381698 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
L381697 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
L381696 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ So... how'd you hear about this?
L381683 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
L381682 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
L381681 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
L381680 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
L381864 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ You're not taking me in!
L381863 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
L381853 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
L381852 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
L381851 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And I'm arranging deportation papers.
L381850 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
L381849 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
L381847 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
L381846 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You figured what?
L381845 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
L381839 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Maybe you need a closer look.
L381838 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ No.
L381837 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
L382195 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
L382194 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Goodwill...
L382179 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
L382178 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
L381997 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
L381996 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Come on now.  People are smart.
L381995 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
L381994 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ How could it not?
L381993 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
L381430 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
L381429 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ It's... coming.
L381428 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
L381427 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ I dunno. One?
L381426 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
L381425 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
L381424 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
L381423 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Er. well, nowhere special.
L381422 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
L381421 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Nowhere.
L382130 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cause I think we're looking at it.
L382129 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ How'd you know that?  Kay?
L382128 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
L382127 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Actually, yeah--
L382126 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Did he say where?
L382125 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Noon exactly.
L382124 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
L382123 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Yeah, Kay?
L382122 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
L381702 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Nope.  Nothing at all.
L381701 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
L381700 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Nothing.
L381699 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ ... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
L381473 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yeah, I'll talk to you.
L381472 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
L381471 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ So... now what?  Cattle call again?
L381822 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ This guy.  Where was he?
L381821 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
L381819 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I promised I wouldn't tell.
L381818 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
L381817 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Found it.
L381812 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I wanna make a deal.
L381811 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
L381810 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Will it lower the curve?
L381809 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
L381808 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What if I don't?
L381807 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
L381806 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ They're not my pals--
L381805 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
L382142 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Wait-- listen--
L382141 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Really nice wheels, by the way.
L382078 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
L382077 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Which way?
L382063 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ The what?
L382062 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We need to talk to you about the alien.
L381725 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
L381724 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
L381716 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Come again?
L381715 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
L381689 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ May I have a look?
L381688 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
L381686 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
L381685 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ This it?
L381677 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Scientific American?  Really?
L381676 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
L382094 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
L382093 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ How'd you know?
L382090 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't tell me.  Insects.
L382089 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
L382088 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
L382087 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yeah?  What's up?
L382049 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh shit!
L382048 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Actually, I don't know...
L382047 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Did it leave?
L382046 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Well, it wasn't in the jar...
L382009 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
L382008 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Where's he making his big speech?
L382007 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
L381956 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
L381955 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ They went right to the President.
L381954 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And they're buying it?
L381943 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
L381942 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm getting a trajectory...
L381933 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Dee?  What are you doing here?
L381932 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ They're gone.
L381888 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
L381887 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Hard to tell.  I hope not.
L381886 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
L381885 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
L381884 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
L381883 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
L381882 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ He's gone, too.
L381780 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What the hell is going on?
L381779 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
L381778 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
L381777 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Kay?  What's your 20?
L381596 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
L381595 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
L381468 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Fine.  Good.
L381467 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ How's Dee?
L381992 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
L381991 +++$+++ u1910 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
L381990 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
L381989 +++$+++ u1910 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
L381988 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
L381987 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
L381986 +++$+++ u1910 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
L381985 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
