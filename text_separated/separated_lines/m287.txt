L115485 +++$+++ u4296 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ AMILYN +++$+++ I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
L115484 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
L115483 +++$+++ u4296 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ AMILYN +++$+++ I look horrible.
L115482 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Cheer up.  You may still.
L115481 +++$+++ u4296 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ AMILYN +++$+++ I had him in my grasp.
L115480 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
L115479 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Shut up!  You let him have it!
L115478 +++$+++ u4296 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ AMILYN +++$+++ My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
L115477 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ What's wrong with you!?!
L115279 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
L115278 +++$+++ u4296 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ AMILYN +++$+++ I don't think this is gold.
L115442 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes!
L115441 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Let's move out!
L115440 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Nice to feel needed.
L115434 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What's with you?
L115433 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
L115431 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Coach knows what abs are?
L115430 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
L115429 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ ... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
L115064 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Litter, yeah!
L115063 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well, um... litter?
L115059 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
L115058 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I like it.  Can I be your friend?
L115762 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
L115761 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
L115698 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
L115697 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Buffy!  Looking tasty.
L115436 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
L115435 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Don't grab me, okay?
L115080 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
L115079 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Man has a complex.
L114990 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Andy!
L114989 +++$+++ u4297 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
L114988 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nice game.
L115377 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I mean it.
L115376 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ I'm hungry.
L115375 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Get away from here.
L115374 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
L115373 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
L115372 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
L115371 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ I... feel.... pretty.
L115370 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You look like shit, Benny.
L115369 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ I'm fine.
L115368 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
L115367 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Invite me in, Pike.
L115366 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
L115365 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Let me in.
L115364 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
L115164 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
L115163 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
L115162 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You think?  Split?
L115161 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
L115140 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
L115139 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
L115138 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
L115137 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
L115136 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Would you sleep with them?
L115135 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
L115134 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You didn't like them.
L115133 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
L115132 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Bummer metaphor.
L115131 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Hey!  She wasted my dog!
L115125 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ We hate you guys!
L115124 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ You're the guys from the movie!
L115118 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
L115117 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Figures.
L115108 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Amazing!
L115107 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ It's coffee.
L115106 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
L115105 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
L115104 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
L114974 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
L114973 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ No, we didn't.
L114968 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Wrong answer!  No prize.
L114967 +++$+++ u4298 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Suck!
L114966 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Booo!
L115596 +++$+++ u4299 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BIKER +++$+++ Down there.
L115595 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Which way did she go?
L115594 +++$+++ u4299 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BIKER +++$+++ My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
L115593 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Wheels?
L115592 +++$+++ u4299 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BIKER +++$+++ Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
L115591 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L115590 +++$+++ u4299 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BIKER +++$+++ You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
L115589 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Did you see a girl come by here?
L115641 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
L115640 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He doesn't look fifty.
L115625 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Hi, guys.
L115624 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hi, Buffy.
L115428 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Eeyuu.
L115427 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Dying.
L115174 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Don't tread on the earth?
L115173 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
L115042 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
L115041 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
L114977 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Probably.  What movie is this?
L114976 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh, my God.  Is that true?
L114959 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
L114958 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
L114957 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
L114950 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What's playing there?
L114949 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Excellent.
L115668 +++$+++ u4301 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY'S MOM +++$+++ Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
L115667 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
L115666 +++$+++ u4301 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY'S MOM +++$+++ What's Bobby gonna say?
L115665 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Maybe.
L115664 +++$+++ u4301 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY'S MOM +++$+++ Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
L115663 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Yeah?
L115662 +++$+++ u4301 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY'S MOM +++$+++ Buffy, honey?
L115254 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Uum... around ten?
L115253 +++$+++ u4301 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY'S MOM +++$+++ Do you know what time it is?
L115722 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'm out of here.  Jenny.
L115721 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You left me a message?
L115720 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You weren't home.  Like always.
L115719 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You broke up with my machine?
L115718 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Didn't you get my message?
L115717 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No, you didn't.  When?
L115716 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
L115715 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I don't understand.
L115714 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'm here with Jenny.
L115713 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I thought we were meeting here.
L115712 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Buffy, what are you doing here?
L115537 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
L115536 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
L115439 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ So I noticed.
L115438 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
L115262 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ 'Bye.
L115261 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
L115260 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
L115259 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
L115258 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I do?  I guess I do.
L115257 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
L115184 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Jealous?
L115183 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
L115045 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Hi.
L115044 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hey there.
L115035 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nothing.  It was just a dream.
L115034 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Come on, what was it?
L115033 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nothing.
L115032 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What'd you dream about?
L115031 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You were having a nightmare.
L115030 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
L115025 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Mmmnkay.
L115024 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
L115023 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
L115022 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It's the news, Buffy.
L115021 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What show is this?
L115020 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
L115019 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Something like that.
L115018 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
L115017 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
L115007 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
L115006 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You okay?
L115825 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I am so sure.
L115824 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ I am a God!  A God!
L115813 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No...
L115812 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
L115811 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I think you've forgotten something.
L115810 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ You're even weaker than the others.
L115808 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ What?
L115807 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
L115806 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
L115840 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
L115839 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
L115838 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
L115837 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
L115836 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
L115820 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Get away from me!
L115819 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Are you okay?
L115764 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
L115763 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Good thing one of us was prepared.
L115760 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You say that like it's a bad thing.
L115759 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
L115758 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
L115757 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm going out the front.
L115729 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
L115728 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
L115727 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
L115726 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm glad you came.
L115725 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ That's me.
L115724 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Pretty shallow of you.
L115723 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I crashed your party.
L115692 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
L115691 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Leave me alone.
L115690 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I should have known.
L115689 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
L115688 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
L115687 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ He did what he was supposed to.
L115686 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
L115685 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
L115684 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
L115683 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
L115682 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
L115681 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
L115680 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ What for?
L115679 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm going to the dance.
L115678 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Second word... sound like 'dance'.
L115677 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm going to the senior dance.
L115676 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Come again?
L115675 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ For the dance.
L115674 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Dress, huh?  What for?
L115673 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ A dress.
L115672 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
L115671 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
L115670 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
L115604 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Merrick...
L115603 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Who?
L115602 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
L115601 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Buffy?  What's wrong?
L115588 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
L115587 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
L115585 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Besides, Oxnard sucks.
L115584 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Thanks.
L115583 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
L115582 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why'd you come back?
L115581 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I know.
L115580 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I didn't expect to see you.
L115521 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
L115520 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Yeah?
L115519 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hey, Buffy...
L115518 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Mmkay.
L115517 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
L115516 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You sure?
L115515 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
L115514 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
L115513 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ No, you're not.
L115512 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
L115511 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
L115510 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
L115509 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I'll back that up.
L115508 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Things are kind of confusing.
L115505 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
L115504 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
L115503 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
L115502 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Where are you gonna go?
L115501 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
L115500 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well, stay here tonight.
L115499 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
L115498 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
L115497 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
L115496 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Yeah.
L115495 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ They were vampires, weren't they?
L115494 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Not exactly.
L115493 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
L115492 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Water.  Okay.
L115491 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You want some water or something?
L115490 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
L115489 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ How are you doing?
L115473 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
L115472 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Is that your car?
L115471 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hi there.
L115470 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Hi.
L115116 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Buffy.
L115115 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
L115112 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You guys are thrashed.
L115111 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
L114965 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It could happen.
L114964 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Will you guys shut up, please?
L115093 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Like my homework.
L115092 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Like what?
L115091 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
L115090 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
L115089 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Bogutude.  Blow it off.
L115088 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
L115070 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
L115069 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Bugs.
L115057 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
L115056 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ It is a pretty crucial subject.
L115053 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ 'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
L115052 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
L115707 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I know.  I like your little outfit.
L115706 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You look way pretty, Kim.
L115705 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Yeah, whoops I came.
L115704 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
L115657 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Get out of my facial.
L115656 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
L115647 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
L115646 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
L115645 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Excuse me for having something important to do.
L115630 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh my God you're having an affair.
L115629 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
L115628 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
L115627 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I forgot.
L115626 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ You were supposed to be here at three.
L115147 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Get a boob job.
L115146 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
L115145 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
L115095 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
L115094 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
L115085 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Cafe Blase.
L115084 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Where?
L115083 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Let's meet tonight, okay?
L114961 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ 'Just remember you're in training, son'
L114960 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ What did Jeffrey's dad say?
L114952 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Nice ensemble!
L114951 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
L114948 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
L114947 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
L114944 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
L114943 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Beverly Center.
L114938 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Well, where?
L114937 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why don't we see a movie?
L114936 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ What are we doing?
L114934 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Please.  It's so '91.
L114933 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ ) What do you think?
L114932 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
L115570 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ He knows who I am!
L115569 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Wait!
L115535 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ And where are they now?
L115534 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
L115533 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
L115532 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Football is my life.
L115531 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
L115530 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
L115529 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
L115528 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ All right.
L115527 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
L115526 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
L115525 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
L115524 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Another distraction.  It's not right.
L115523 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
L115522 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ There isn't time.
L115475 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
L115474 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Interesting.
L115451 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
L115450 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I want to die.
L115449 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
L115448 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
L115447 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
L115446 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
L115445 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
L115444 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I can't work this.
L115443 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
L115423 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
L115422 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Vampires of the world, beware.
L115421 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
L115420 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ As for example, what?
L115419 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
L115418 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ And it makes it worse when I die, right?
L115417 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
L115416 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm curious, is all.
L115415 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It isn't important.
L115414 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I wish you would.
L115413 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
L115412 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Watchers?
L115411 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
L115410 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ How can you keep doing this?
L115409 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Not if you're careful.
L115408 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
L115407 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Five.
L115406 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Five?
L115405 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
L115404 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I...
L115403 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
L115402 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, fuck you!
L115401 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
L115400 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
L115399 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Buffy...
L115398 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
L115397 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Don't start with me again.
L115396 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
L115395 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ A what?
L115394 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You are such a wet.
L115393 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
L115392 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
L115391 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
L115390 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
L115389 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
L115388 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
L115387 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
L115386 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Fine.
L115385 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
L115358 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Try to pay attention.
L115357 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What!?!
L115347 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh.
L115346 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Same one.
L115345 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ They were vampires?
L115344 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
L115343 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ My nails.
L115342 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
L115341 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
L115340 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
L115339 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
L115338 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
L115337 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
L115336 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Your turn.
L115335 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
L115334 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
L115333 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
L115332 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
L115331 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Put your head back.
L115330 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
L115329 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh.  Sorry.
L115328 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I don't think you understand the full implications of --
L115327 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
L115326 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It was necessary.
L115325 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
L115324 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
L115323 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ But you threw a knife at my head!
L115322 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I had to test you.
L115321 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
L115319 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh.  Good.
L115318 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
L115317 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
L115316 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No -- you don't have to --
L115315 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Who we gonna beat?
L115314 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Who we gonna beat?
L115313 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Okay.
L115312 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
L115311 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Here?
L115310 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
L115309 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Sporting events, yeah.
L115308 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
L115307 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
L115306 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ But you enjoyed it, yes?
L115305 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
L115304 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
L115303 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Uh... gym.
L115302 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
L115301 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Not a pressing issue.
L115300 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
L115299 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
L115298 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
L115297 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
L115296 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ We'll cover it later.
L115295 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What?
L115294 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
L115293 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, him.
L115292 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
L115291 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
L115290 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
L115289 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why do you keep saying that?
L115288 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
L115287 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What, um...  What do we do?
L115286 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Our purposes.
L115285 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
L115252 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's true.
L115251 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
L115249 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Skip it.
L115248 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I have cheerleading squad.
L115247 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Meet me at this address after school.
L115246 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ All right.
L115245 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
L115244 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ She --
L115243 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Where's the other one?
L115240 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ We wait for Robert to wake up.
L115239 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ All right.  What do we do now?
L115238 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
L115237 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Wait a minute.
L115235 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ This is it.
L115234 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ None of your business.  God.
L115233 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Cramps?
L115232 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Ow.
L115231 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
L115230 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
L115229 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
L115228 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I have to show you.
L115227 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ How do you know all this?
L115226 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Lothos.
L115225 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
L115224 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
L115223 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ China.
L115222 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
L115221 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ In Virginia.
L115220 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I was a slave.
L115219 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
L115218 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Everybody does.
L115217 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
L115216 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Just stay away from me, okay?
L115212 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
L115211 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
L115210 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L115209 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
L115208 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
L115207 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Time to do what?
L115206 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
L115205 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
L115204 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
L115203 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
L115202 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Wait!
L115201 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
L115200 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
L115199 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
L115198 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
L115197 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ To bring you... your birthright.
L115196 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why?
L115195 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
L115194 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L115193 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
L115192 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Am I in trouble or something?
L115191 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I'm looking for you, actually.
L115190 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
L115189 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
L115188 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
L115703 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh.
L115702 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I haven't seen him tonight.
L115701 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
L115700 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Hi.
L115699 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Hi, guys.
L115660 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Later for it.
L115659 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nicole...
L115658 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Well, I guess you got what you came for.
L115639 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You're having a fling with him?
L115638 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Pike.
L115550 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Sorry.
L115549 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
L115265 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
L115264 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Thanks.
L115263 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
L115187 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ B'bye.
L115186 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
L115185 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
L115182 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I guess.
L115181 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Yeah... She's okay, though.
L115180 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Cassandra's really smart.
L115179 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
L115176 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
L115175 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I don't get it.
L115172 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
L115171 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L115170 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ That is so cool.
L115157 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  It was mondo bizarro.
L115156 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I was just scared is all.
L115155 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ -- like she's gonna kill me.
L115142 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
L115141 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Come one, that was so weird.
L115087 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
L115086 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
L114956 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Good enough!
L114955 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ That's the plan.
L114954 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
L114942 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ They don't even have Dolby.
L114941 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No THX.
L114930 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
L114929 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
L114928 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
L115282 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Swear to God.
L115281 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Really?
L115280 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
L115273 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
L115272 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ What... are you?
L115271 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
L115270 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ My parents have money...
L115269 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ So very much.
L115268 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ What's happening?  What do you want?
L115267 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
L114921 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You are much more.
L114920 +++$+++ u4303 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I'm just a girl.
L114919 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
L114918 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
L114917 +++$+++ u4303 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I don't understand.
L114916 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ The mark of the Coven.
L114915 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
L114914 +++$+++ u4303 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Why?  Why me?
L114913 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
L114912 +++$+++ u4303 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I can't!
L115003 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ Good.
L115002 +++$+++ u4313 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Got that.
L115001 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
L115000 +++$+++ u4313 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Could be.
L114999 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ You think so?
L114998 +++$+++ u4313 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Could be.
L114997 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
L114996 +++$+++ u4313 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Hi, Grueller.
L114995 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ Bessel!  What are you doing here?
L115832 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I heard she got straight A's.
L115831 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
L115783 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ But --
L115782 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay, let's go.
L115781 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No --
L115780 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
L115779 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Jeffrey!
L115778 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Buffy?
L115776 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
L115775 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh, baby!
L115774 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh, yes!  Yes!
L115066 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Okay, what else?
L115065 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Write that down.
L115830 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Buffy?
L115829 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
L115653 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Okay.
L115652 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And Spring Fling.
L115620 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Throw it out.
L115619 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
L115426 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
L115425 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Well, I hope so.
L115424 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
L115144 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Where'd you learn how to do that?
L115143 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I can't believe they still ate it.
L115632 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Does Jeffrey know?
L115631 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Cool!
L115566 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What is she...
L115565 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Buffy!
L115178 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I gotta bail.  You coming?
L115177 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I never thought of that.
L115154 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
L115153 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
L115152 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
L115151 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're kidding.
L115150 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
L115149 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What happened?
L114940 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Nee sitch.  No way.
L114939 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Omniplex?
L115754 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You want some punch?
L115753 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ They'll kill us!
L115123 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hey, wait a minute...
L115122 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
L115121 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
L115120 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Wit-tay.
L115119 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
L115709 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
L115708 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
L115655 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
L115654 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ And the January Semi-formal --
L115651 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Right.
L115650 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Except for Prom.
L115649 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
L115648 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ So, we're stupid now?
L115644 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
L115643 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Like you've got a grip.
L115642 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh, thank you very much.
L115637 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
L115636 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L115623 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
L115622 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
L115621 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I really was way way too too.
L115159 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
L115158 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Buffy, the ape-woman.
L115110 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Nice much.
L115109 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Smell of booze much.
L115098 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Well, look who's here.
L115097 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
L115096 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
L115072 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Right!
L115071 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh, yeah!
L115061 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Okay.
L115060 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Environment.  That's cool with me.
L115040 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh, please.
L115039 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ The homelesses?
L114970 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Like we don't have rights too?
L114969 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ God!  Take a chill lozenge.
L114963 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ He is so bald.
L114962 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Oh, God.
L115464 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Run.
L115463 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
L115462 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I am.
L115461 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ All right.  Take care of yourself.
L115460 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L115459 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ Ah, you'll be coming back.
L115458 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
L115457 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ No...  You want me to give him a message?
L115456 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
L115455 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
L115454 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
L115453 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
