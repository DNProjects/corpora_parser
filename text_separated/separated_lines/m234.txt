L14289 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ For what?
L14288 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
L14287 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Should you see a doctor?
L14286 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ It's not my time of month.
L14285 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ What do you mean?
L14284 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ It's not that... it's not that...
L14283 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
L14281 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Say it!
L14280 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes, Mother.
L14279 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
L14278 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ They were stained.
L14277 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why?
L14276 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I burnt them.
L14275 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
L14274 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No.
L14273 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
L14272 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ It made them holy.
L14271 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
L14270 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
L14269 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why?
L14268 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes Mother.
L14267 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
L14117 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Dear Jesus...
L14116 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I don't know.
L14115 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why?
L14114 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I'm being punished.
L14113 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes, of God.
L14112 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Of God.
L14111 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
L14110 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No I don't... the host is enough.
L14109 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You've got to eat something Agnes.
L14108 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L14107 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
L14106 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ But she watches... she listens.
L14105 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
L14104 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
L14103 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who?
L14102 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
L14101 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh my dear child.
L14100 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
L14099 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
L14098 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
L14097 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ That's not what he meant.
L14096 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
L14095 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who tells you these things?
L14094 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
L14093 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Agnes...
L14092 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Look at the statues, they're thin.
L14091 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why?
L14090 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ It's a sin to be fat.
L14089 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who told you this?
L14088 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
L14087 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ He loves you the way you are.
L14086 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I do, I have to be attractive to God.
L14085 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ ... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
L14084 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Because...
L14083 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
L14082 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I'm a blimp.
L14081 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Agnes...
L14080 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I am, there's too much flesh on me.
L14079 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, for Heaven's sake.
L14078 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Because I'm getting fat.
L14077 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who?
L14076 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No.
L14075 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ One of the other Sisters?
L14074 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She'd punish me.
L14073 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why?
L14072 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I can't say.
L14071 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who?
L14070 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14069 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Through someone else?
L14068 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No.
L14067 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ He talked to you Himself?
L14066 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
L14755 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
L14754 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ H... how?
L14753 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I put her to sleep.
L14752 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What did you do?
L14751 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
L14750 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
L14749 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14748 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You saw it all didn't you?
L14747 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14746 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She took the baby in her arms?
L14745 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14744 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
L14740 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I don't remember.
L14739 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It was alive wasn't it?
L14738 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ It was dead.
L14733 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
L14732 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
L14731 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, who did this to you?

L14722 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Not your fault...
L14721 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
L14720 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No...
L14719 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?

L14502 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
L14501 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Of telling you.
L14500 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Of what?
L14499 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I'm frightened.
L14498 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
L14497 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Because I'm in trouble.
L14496 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
L14495 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ To help me.
L14494 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And why am I here?
L14493 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Doctor Livingston.
L14492 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who am I?
L14491 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14490 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
L14372 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ As much as God loves you.
L14371 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ As much as Mother Miriam does?
L14370 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I really love you.
L14369 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
L14368 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
L14367 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
L14366 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You're a mistake.
L14365 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes I am.
L14364 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Are you intelligent?
L14363 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No I'm not.
L14362 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, you're stupid.
L14361 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14360 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Are you pretty?
L14359 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No I'm not.
L14358 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
L14357 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Alright.
L14356 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
L14355 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I'm afraid.
L14354 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
L14353 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
L14352 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What?
L14351 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ And then...
L14350 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L14349 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Her headaches.
L14348 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How does she know that?
L14347 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
L14346 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why?
L14345 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She says my whole body's a mistake.
L14344 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That you're a mistake?
L14343 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14342 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And that you're stupid?
L14341 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14340 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She tells you you're ugly?
L14339 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
L14338 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Yes?
L14337 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ ... makes me...
L14336 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Yes?
L14335 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She...
L14334 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
L14333 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She watches... she listens.
L14332 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How?
L14331 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She can.
L14330 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She can't hurt you any more.
L14329 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14328 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She's dead isn't she?
L14327 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I can't.
L14326 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You can tell me.
L14325 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No...
L14324 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
L14323 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I breathed!
L14322 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What did you do?
L14321 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I'm always bad.
L14320 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What did you do?
L14319 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
L14318 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Sometimes, yes.
L14317 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Answer me!  You never answer me.
L14316 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes...
L14315 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
L14314 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And you're unhappy.
L14313 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
L14312 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ But you're troubled... aren't you?
L14311 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I'm not sick.
L14310 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
L14220 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes...
L14219 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Everything... I don't have children.
L14218 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What the child?
L14217 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I was a mistake.
L14216 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ ... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
L14215 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Not my fault.
L14214 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ ... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
L14213 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I can't help it if I'm stupid.
L14212 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
L14211 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
L14210 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Is that what she said?
L14209 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ A mistake... it was a mistake...
L14208 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, how did your mother get you?
L14207 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ A mistake...
L14206 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
L14205 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Like you?
L14204 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
L14203 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
L14202 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Because I don't want one.
L14201 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why not?
L14200 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
L14199 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why not?
L14198 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I could never be a mother.
L14197 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
L14196 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L14195 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, did you love your mother?
L14194 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She'd get angry.
L14193 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why not?  Mmm?
L14192 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No, but I can never tell her that.
L14191 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you believe she really saw them?
L14190 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No.
L14189 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you?
L14188 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No.
L14187 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Did your mother see angels often?
L14186 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
L14185 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
L14184 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ You'll laugh.
L14183 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes...
L14182 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I don't know.
L14181 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who?
L14180 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Somebody told her.
L14179 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How did she know that?
L14178 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
L14177 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What things?
L14176 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
L14175 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You have trouble sleeping?
L14174 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
L14173 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
L14172 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Where did you go?
L14171 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
L14170 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
L14169 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
L14165 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
L14164 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
L14163 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
L14162 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
L14161 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Like what?
L14160 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
L14159 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
L14158 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
L14157 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
L14155 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
L14154 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What else did she tell you?
L14153 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
L14152 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You liked Sister Paul?
L13997 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I don't know.
L13996 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why should I?
L13995 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No... do you?
L13994 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you know a Marie?
L13993 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
L13992 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
L13991 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Where do you think babies come from?
L13990 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What?
L13989 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ One.
L13988 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
L13987 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No questions.
L13986 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Does it bother you?
L13985 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Why do you smoke?
L13984 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I've stopped menstruating
L13983 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Why not?
L13982 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I can't have them any more.
L13981 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Would you like some?
L13980 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No.
L13979 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Do you have any children?
L13978 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Not at the moment, no.
L13977 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Would you like to be?
L13976 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No.
L13975 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Are you married?
L13974 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Martha Louise Livingston.
L13973 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ What's your real name?
L13972 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Anything.
L13971 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Anything?
L13970 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
L13969 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ What do you mean?
L13968 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Would you like to ask them?
L13967 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
L13966 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes...
L13965 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
L13964 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Then let's talk about something else...
L13963 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
L13962 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Yes I do,  but I want you to...
L13961 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Don't you know?
L13960 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, how are babies born?
L13959 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I... I don't understand.
L13958 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ After God... before the waste-paper basket.
L13957 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ From God.
L13956 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Where'd it come from before that?
L13955 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
L13954 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Is that where they say it came from... ?
L13953 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ From their heads...
L13952 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ The baby they made up.
L13951 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ What baby?
L13950 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Where did the baby come from?
L13949 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L13948 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ In the middle of all the pain?
L13947 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I fell asleep.
L13946 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And then what?
L13945 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I got sicker.
L13944 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And what happened?
L13943 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I went to my room.
L13942 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And what did you do?
L13941 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Down... there.
L13940 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Where?
L13939 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L13938 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Did it hurt?
L13937 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Something I ate.
L13936 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How were you sick?
L13935 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No. I was sick.
L13934 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you remember the night they said it came?
L13933 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I don't know.
L13932 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why should they?
L13931 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
L13930 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Would you like to talk about it?
L13929 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ You want to talk about the baby don't you?
L13927 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ In the confessional.
L13926 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Where do you meet?
L13925 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L13924 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And you like that?
L13923 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ At least once a week.
L13922 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Often?
L13921 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L13920 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You've been alone together?
L13919 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
L13918 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ He's told you?
L13917 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Oh, I know he does.
L13916 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you think he loves you?
L13915 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Oh, yes!
L13914 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
L13913 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Oh, there are so many.
L13912 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who?
L13911 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L13910 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
L13909 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I love you.
L13908 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Uh huh.
L13907 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Right now?
L13906 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well, who in particular?
L13905 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Everyone.
L13904 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who?
L13903 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L13902 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Have you ever loved anyone?
L13901 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Love.
L13900 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Second thing that comes to your mind.
L13899 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
L13898 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ First thing that comes to your mind?
L13897 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L13896 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Anything... may I sit down?
L13895 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ I don't know.
L13894 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What would you like to talk about.
L13893 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Let's talk about something else.
L13892 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
L13891 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No I'm not.
L13890 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Was it Sister Marguerite?
L13889 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ That wasn't me.
L13888 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I just heard you.
L13887 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ No I don't.
L13886 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You have a lovely voice.
L13885 +++$+++ u3549 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ AGNES +++$+++ Yes.
L13884 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
L14378 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Sister...
L14377 +++$+++ u3550 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ ELDERLY NUN +++$+++ Look into the convent records.
L14376 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What?
L14375 +++$+++ u3550 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ ELDERLY NUN +++$+++ ???
L14374 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
L14373 +++$+++ u3550 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ ELDERLY NUN +++$+++ I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
L14147 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
L14146 +++$+++ u3551 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The bishop is breathing down our necks.
L14145 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why?
L14144 +++$+++ u3551 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
L14143 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
L14142 +++$+++ u3551 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
L13828 +++$+++ u3551 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
L13827 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Eve, she strangled a baby!
L13826 +++$+++ u3551 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
L13825 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
L14417 +++$+++ u3552 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ If I find anything I'll call you.
L14416 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Thanks. 
L14415 +++$+++ u3552 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
L14414 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
L14413 +++$+++ u3552 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
L14412 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Larry...
L14411 +++$+++ u3552 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You got to be crazy.
L14410 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I don't know.
L14409 +++$+++ u3552 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
L14408 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Something they... that they overlooked.
L14407 +++$+++ u3552 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
L14406 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Larry there's got to be something missing.
L14405 +++$+++ u3552 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Marty, what are you doing here?
L14404 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Larry...
L14132 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Thanks...
L14131 +++$+++ u3552 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
L14651 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
L14650 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ No!
L14649 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I can get you new evidence next week.
L14648 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ No, no, no...
L14647 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Next week.
L14646 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ When?
L14645 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I'll have it.
L14644 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ You have proof?
L14643 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
L14642 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ It's gone on long enough. You're out.
L14641 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I'll have a decision by next week.
L14640 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
L14639 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
L14638 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
L14637 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ All I want is one more week.
L14149 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
L14148 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ ???
L14139 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
L14138 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
L13822 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What about Roger? He's free.
L13821 +++$+++ u3553 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ LEVEAU +++$+++ Martha, it's you.
L14044 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I... I'm Martha, Mama.
L14043 +++$+++ u3554 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Who are you?
L14042 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
L14041 +++$+++ u3554 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
L14040 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Marie's dead Mama.
L14039 +++$+++ u3554 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
L14038 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
L14037 +++$+++ u3554 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Not any more... now I like chocolate.
L14036 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
L14035 +++$+++ u3554 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
L14034 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
L14033 +++$+++ u3554 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Who are you?
L14032 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's your favourite...
L14031 +++$+++ u3554 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
L14030 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
L14054 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Uh huh.
L14053 +++$+++ u3558 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ SISTER ANNE +++$+++ Yes.
L14052 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ The one up on the third floor?
L14051 +++$+++ u3558 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ SISTER ANNE +++$+++ Oh that one there, in the corner.
L14050 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
L14049 +++$+++ u3558 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ SISTER ANNE +++$+++ No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
L14048 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
L14047 +++$+++ u3558 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ SISTER ANNE +++$+++ Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
L14046 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How do you survive?
L14045 +++$+++ u3558 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ SISTER ANNE +++$+++ The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
L14309 +++$+++ u3556 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MONSIGNOR +++$+++ Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
L14308 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
L14307 +++$+++ u3556 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MONSIGNOR +++$+++ But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
L14306 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
L14305 +++$+++ u3556 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MONSIGNOR +++$+++ Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
L14304 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What business is it of yours..?
L14303 +++$+++ u3556 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MONSIGNOR +++$+++ Do you still go to church?
L14302 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who told you this?
L14301 +++$+++ u3556 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MONSIGNOR +++$+++ And you had a sister who died in the convent.
L14300 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What does this have to do with..?
L14299 +++$+++ u3556 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MONSIGNOR +++$+++ Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
L14298 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
L14297 +++$+++ u3556 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MONSIGNOR +++$+++ Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
L14296 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No.
L14742 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Wasn't it!
L14741 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, don't do this!
L14737 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What happened to the baby?
L14736 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She can't remember.
L14735 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Agnes, what happened to the baby?
L14734 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ That's enough.
L14685 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Then she's a liar.
L14684 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I doubt that's what she'd say.
L14683 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I left it with her and I went for help.
L14682 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Before or after you killed the child?
L14681 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
L14680 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You tied the cord around its neck.
L14679 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ No!
L14678 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And the baby.
L14677 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
L14676 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
L14675 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ That's a lie.
L14674 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You wanted that child out of the way.
L14673 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She didn't want any help.
L14672 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You went to the room to help with the birth.
L14671 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ The scandal...
L14670 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ The baby?
L14669 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I don't know... too late to stop it.
L14668 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Too late for what?
L14667 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, don't be ridiculous.
L14666 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ For what?  An abortion?
L14665 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I didn't guess until it was too late.
L14664 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And you didn't send her to a doctor.
L14663 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L14662 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Did you know she was pregnant?
L14661 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Is it because she's a nun?
L14660 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Was it you?
L14659 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why do you insist upon pressing...
L14658 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who knew she was pregnant?
L14657 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ My God, but you're determined.
L14656 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I have a few more questions to ask her.
L14655 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Hasn't she had enough?
L14654 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Where is she?
L14653 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ This is permission to take her apart.
L14636 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
L14635 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
L14634 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I'm concerned about her health.
L14633 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
L14632 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why would I lie?
L14631 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
L14630 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
L14629 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Somebody told her.
L14628 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
L14627 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
L14626 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
L14625 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That's what I have to believe...
L14624 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
L14623 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
L14622 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She is an innocent.
L14621 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
L14620 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
L14619 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
L14618 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
L14617 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ But how did it happen?
L14616 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You're saying God did it?
L14615 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
L14614 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ This is insane.
L14613 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
L14612 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well give me a reasonable explanation
L14611 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.
L14610 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How  ?
L14609 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
L14608 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ My God, you're as crazy as...
L14607 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Why must he be anybody?
L14606 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who is he?
L14605 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ The father!
L14604 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
L14603 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She's been touched by God, yes.
L14602 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You think she's a saint?
L14601 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ For Agnes.
L14600 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ For the Church?
L14599 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
L14598 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ One that will ask the questions you want asked.
L14597 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
L14596 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You're what?
L14595 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
L14573 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ NO... no... I said leave her alone.
L14572 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
L14489 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Then let's begin.
L14488 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Of course.
L14487 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ May I be present?
L14486 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No.
L14485 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Would it stop you if I did?
L14484 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
L14483 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Begin what?
L14482 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I'd like to begin.
L14481 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Listen to her singing.
L14480 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
L14479 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
L14478 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
L14477 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Become?  One is born a saint.
L14476 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you want to become one?
L14475 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes I do.
L14474 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you think they ever existed?
L14473 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
L14472 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
L14471 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ And Saint John would chew tobacco.
L14470 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh, you've come a long way baby.
L14469 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Mary Magdelen?
L14468 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Right...
L14467 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Pipe!
L14466 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Saint Peter?
L14465 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Even Christ would partake socially.
L14464 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Hand rolled.
L14463 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
L14462 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Long, thin and filtered.
L14461 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
L14460 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
L14459 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Fine thanks...
L14458 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ All right?
L14457 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
L14456 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I'd love one.
L14455 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Would you like one?  Huh?
L14454 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ No, it reminds me.
L14453 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
L14451 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
L14450 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ So you left the Church because you had freckles?
L14449 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
L14448 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ And what has that to do with it?
L14447 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
L14446 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Stupid woman... and that's all?
L14445 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
L14444 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
L14443 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Nothing...
L14442 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
L14441 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You just said...
L14440 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
L14439 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
L14438 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Bullshit yourself!
L14437 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Bullshit!
L14436 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Because I am a moral person.
L14435 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
L14434 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
L14433 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ An unhappy woman...
L14431 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I know you don't.
L14430 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
L14429 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Her spiritual health.
L14428 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ The woman's health is at stake.
L14427 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I haven't decided yet.
L14426 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Don't deny it!
L14425 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ We'll see about that.
L14424 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I'd like yours too.
L14423 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ And my permission?
L14403 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh, God.
L14402 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Because I didn't know... 
L14401 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
L14400 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I knew that after the fact.
L14399 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
L14398 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh God, if only I'd known.
L14397 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
L14396 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, dear God.
L14395 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She molested her!
L14394 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I don't think I care to know.
L14393 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you know what she did to her?
L14392 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She drank too much. That's what killed her.
L14391 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Listening to angels?
L14390 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L14389 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Like keeping her home from school?
L14387 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And Agnes' father?
L14386 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
L14385 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
L14384 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
L14383 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Your niece!
L14382 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ About what?
L14381 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You lied to me
L14295 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
L14294 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Sister Paul?
L14293 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
L14292 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ When was that?
L14265 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
L14264 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What sheets?
L14263 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ The sheets...
L14262 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What is it?
L14261 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, Dear God...
L14260 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Was the child full term?
L14259 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ There's nothing here.
L14258 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Take at look at it.
L14257 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L14256 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
L14255 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Nothing.
L14254 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Visitors to the convent.
L14253 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Earthquakes?
L14252 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
L14251 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, some time in January.
L14250 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ When would Agnes have conceived the child?
L14249 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Answers.
L14248 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ All right, what do you need.
L14247 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
L14246 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ How?
L14245 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Aquittal.
L14244 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ What?
L14243 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ There's another choice.
L14242 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
L14241 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
L14240 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I am...
L14239 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Then help her.
L14238 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
L14237 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ ???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
L14236 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ ???  
L14235 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
L14234 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She is not a child.
L14233 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
L14232 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I'm only interested...
L14231 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
L14230 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ It's my affair too.
L14229 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
L14228 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
L14227 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
L14226 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ The Catholic Church...
L14225 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I hate ignorance and stupidity.
L14224 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Nuns... you hate nuns.
L14223 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What?
L14222 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You hate us don't you?
L14129 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
L14128 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
L14127 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
L14126 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
L14125 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Not simple, no.
L14124 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
L14123 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She has it now.
L14122 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
L14121 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
L14120 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
L14119 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
L14065 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ About two years before.
L14064 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ This was before her pregnancy?
L14063 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She stopped eating completely...
L14062 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And what happened?
L14061 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I was appalled, just as you are now.
L14060 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And you weren't shocked?
L14059 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Shortly after she came to us.
L14058 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
L14057 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
L14056 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
L14055 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
L14020 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
L14019 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That possibility never occurred to you?
L14018 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ That's absurd!
L14017 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
L14016 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who?
L14015 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's possible isn't it?
L14014 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
L14013 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
L14012 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I've already told you what I thought.
L14011 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And in your eyes?
L14010 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ No... not in the eyes of the police.
L14009 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ So, someone else could have done it.
L14008 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
L14007 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
L14006 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
L14005 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That's ridiculous...
L14004 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
L14003 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
L14002 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
L14001 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
L14000 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I believe Agnes is different.
L13999 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What's your opinion?
L13998 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
L13883 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
L13882 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I am not with the Inquisition.
L13881 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
L13880 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ The science of psychiatry.
L13879 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
L13878 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
L13877 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
L13876 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why do you think that?
L13875 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
L13874 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Look, someone gave her the baby.
L13873 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
L13872 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why haven't you asked her?
L13871 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
L13870 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And you didn't try to find out who?
L13869 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Obviously there was.
L13868 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Could there have been anyone else?
L13867 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
L13866 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What's his name?
L13865 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes, but I...
L13864 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Was there a priest?
L13863 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ None as far as I know.
L13862 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What man had access to her?
L13861 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I haven't a clue.
L13860 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who was the father?
L13859 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
L13858 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
L13857 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
L13856 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How did she hide it during the day?
L13855 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L13854 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Is that normal?
L13853 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
L13852 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How did she hide it from the other nuns?
L13851 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ No-one.
L13850 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
L13849 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Unfiltered.
L13848 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I can beat that.
L13847 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Two packs a day.
L13846 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You were a smoker?
L13845 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
L13844 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ ... Thank you.
L13843 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You can call me Sister.
L13842 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Yes... I...
L13841 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
