L42409 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
L42408 +++$+++ u3676 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ What's your name?
L42407 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
L42406 +++$+++ u3676 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
L42405 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
L42404 +++$+++ u3676 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ What's your name?
L42403 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.

L43480 +++$+++ u3677 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.

L42412 +++$+++ u3676 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ Hey!
L43667 +++$+++ u3678 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTOR +++$+++ Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
L43666 +++$+++ u3679 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTRESS +++$+++ You're like New York. You're an island.
L43665 +++$+++ u3679 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTRESS +++$+++ Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
L43664 +++$+++ u3678 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTOR +++$+++ It's an important issue.
L43663 +++$+++ u3679 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTRESS +++$+++ Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
L43662 +++$+++ u3678 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTOR +++$+++ You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
L43661 +++$+++ u3679 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTRESS +++$+++ What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
L43660 +++$+++ u3678 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTOR +++$+++ You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
L42563 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
L42562 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
L42561 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
L42560 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
L42559 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch.
L42558 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
L42557 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
L42556 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Lyndon Johnson?
L42555 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
L42554 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yeah, Earl Warren?
L42553 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, why not?
L42552 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
L42551 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
L42550 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ We've been through this.
L42548 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Alvy.
L42547 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
L42546 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
L42545 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
L42541 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Portchnik.
L42540 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah? Allison what?
L42539 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Allison.
L42535 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Do you feel all right?
L42534 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
L42533 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yes.
L42532 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
L42531 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
L42530 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
L42529 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ It's okay.
L42528 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
L42527 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Why not?
L42526 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
L42525 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yes.
L42524 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
L42523 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
L42522 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What do you mean, next?
L42521 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
L42520 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
L42519 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Who are you?
L42518 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
L43642 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I thought just earplugs.
L43641 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh!
L43640 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
L43639 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
L43638 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ The what?
L43637 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
L43636 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
L43635 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm late.
L43634 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
L43632 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
L43631 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
L43630 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
L43629 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're mad, aren't you?
L43628 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
L43627 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
L43626 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
L43625 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
L43624 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
L43623 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
L43622 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
L43621 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
L43620 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
L43619 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
L43618 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
L43617 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Alvy, come on.
L43616 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
L43615 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
L43614 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You look very pretty.
L43590 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
L43589 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah.
L43588 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
L43587 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
L43586 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
L43585 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
L43584 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L43583 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
L43582 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
L43581 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
L43580 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
L43578 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
L43577 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Thanks, honey.
L43576 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
L43575 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Remember that day?
L43574 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ God.
L43573 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ This is the first book that I got you.
L43572 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh-
L43571 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
L43570 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
L43569 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
L43568 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
L43567 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
L43566 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
L43565 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
L43564 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
L43563 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
L43555 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
L43554 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
L43553 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
L43552 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
L43551 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm cool.
L43550 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, good. Okay.
L43540 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
L43539 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
L43533 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43532 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, this place is great.
L43470 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Nothing at all?
L43469 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Christ!
L43466 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
L43465 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
L43463 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
L43462 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
L43419 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
L43418 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ God, it's so clean out here.
L43410 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
L43409 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ God.
L43403 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
L43402 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ ...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
L43397 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
L43396 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
L43395 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
L43392 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
L43391 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's sick!
L43390 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
L43389 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
L43385 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
L43384 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
L43383 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
L43382 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
L43381 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
L43380 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
L43379 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
L43378 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
L43377 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
L43376 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
L43373 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
L43372 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.

L43369 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
L43368 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.

L43250 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.

L43225 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.

L43223 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Very big spider.
L43222 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh. What?
L43221 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
L43220 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
L43219 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Is he in the bathroom?
L43218 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.

L43214 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
L43213 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
L43212 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
L43211 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
L43210 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
L43209 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
L43207 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
L43206 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It was just great!
L43205 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
L43204 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43203 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
L43202 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
L43201 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
L43200 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.
L43199 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
L43198 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
L43197 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oooh.
L43196 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
L43195 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
L43194 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
L43193 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What?
L43192 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ There's a spider in the bathroom.
L43191 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
L43190 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh.
L43189 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What's- It's me, open up.
L43141 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
L43140 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm following you and David, if you-
L43139 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
L43138 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ David! David! I can't believe this!
L43137 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
L43136 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
L43134 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
L43133 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
L43132 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Life. I said, "life."
L43131 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
L43130 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
L43129 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
L43128 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Will it change my life?
L43127 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Will it change your wife?
L43126 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
L43125 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
L43124 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
L43123 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
L43122 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
L43121 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Whatta you mean? Me?
L43120 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
L43119 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
L43118 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ and I keep, you know, it's-
L43117 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah?
L43116 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, and he's strangling me...
L43115 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Sinatra?
L43114 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
L43113 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
L43112 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43111 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
L43110 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
L43109 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
L43108 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'hm.
L43107 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
L43106 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
L43105 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'hm.
L43104 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
L43103 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ G-go on, I'm interested.
L43102 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'hm.
L43101 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
L43100 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
L43099 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'm.
L43098 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
L43097 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah?
L43096 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
L43095 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
L43094 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm home!
L43092 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
L43091 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's his name.
L43090 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ David? You call your teacher David?
L43089 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
L43088 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
L43087 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Who cares? Who cares?
L43086 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ "Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
L43085 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
L43084 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
L43083 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
L43082 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
L43081 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ "Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
L43080 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
L43079 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
L43078 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
L43077 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That is the worst kind of paranoia.
L43076 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
L43075 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Do you realize how paranoid you are?
L43074 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Following is different. I was spying.
L43073 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, what is your definition of following?
L43072 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
L43071 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You followed me!
L43070 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I didn't follow you!
L43069 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You followed me. I can't believe it!
L43014 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
L43013 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah.
L43012 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
L43011 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
L43010 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
L43009 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You're so sure about it.
L43006 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
L43005 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43004 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Are yuh?
L43003 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
L43002 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
L43001 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
L42993 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
L42992 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Were you always funny?
L42991 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
L42990 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'hm.
L42989 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
L42988 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I need grass and so do you.
L42987 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
L42986 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, you have my body.
L42983 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
L42982 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Let's just do it, all right?
L42981 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
L42980 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ U-huh.
L42979 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Really?
L42978 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I'm fine.
L42977 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
L42976 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Uh-uh-why?
L42975 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
L42974 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
L42973 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
L42972 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L42971 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, come, you don't need that.
L42970 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
L42969 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
L42968 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, what's the difference, anyway?
L42967 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
L42966 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It relaxes me.
L42965 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
L42964 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, have you ever made love high?
L42963 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
L42962 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
L42961 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
L42960 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
L42959 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
L42958 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
L42957 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
L42956 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
L42955 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, don't be ridiculous.
L42954 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
L42953 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
L42952 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L42951 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ That place is four hundred dollars a month?
L42950 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
L42949 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
L42948 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How is it any different?
L42947 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
L42946 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
L42945 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
L42944 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Mine.
L42943 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
L42942 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You don't want me to live with you?
L42941 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
L42940 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
L42939 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I know it's small.
L42938 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I have a tiny apartment.
L42937 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
L42936 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
L42935 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
L42934 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Of course.
L42933 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
L42932 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I dunno.
L42931 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Don't you think I do?
L42930 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L42929 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
L42928 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L42927 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
L42926 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
L42925 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I know you've only known me a short while.
L42924 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L42923 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ That's the key question.
L42922 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Do I love you?
L42921 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You- Do you love me?
L42920 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
L42919 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
L42918 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Ooooh!
L42917 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
L42916 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
L42915 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
L42914 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I'm not.
L42913 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You are extremely sexy.
L42912 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You see, like you and I...

L42910 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L42909 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
L42908 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah.

L42898 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ U-huh.
L42897 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
L42896 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'hm.
L42895 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
L42894 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.

L42888 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'hm.
L42887 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
L42886 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L42885 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ big subject with me, yeah.

L42882 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
L42881 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
L42880 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ H'm?
L42879 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey?
L42878 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What? What?
L42877 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
L42876 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
L42875 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
L42874 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L42873 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
L42872 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Here, you want some?
L42871 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
L42870 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.
L42869 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Good? I was-
L42868 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
L42867 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
L42866 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.  You're a wreck.
L42865 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.

L42859 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ As Balzac said...
L42858 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
L42857 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh.
L42856 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.

L42589 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
L42587 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
L42586 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
L42585 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
L42584 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
L42583 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
L42582 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
L42581 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
L42580 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ All right. All right. All right.
L42579 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
L42578 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
L42577 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
L42576 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
L42575 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
L42574 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Get him!
L42573 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
L42572 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oooh! Here! Here!
L42571 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Don't give it to me. Don't!
L42570 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
L42569 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
L42568 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
L42567 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
L42566 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
L42565 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
L42564 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
L42515 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
L42514 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'm.
L42513 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
L42512 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
L42511 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
L42510 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
L42509 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I-you know, I don't wanna.
L42508 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What-what-what-what's the matter?
L42507 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, I...
L42506 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
L42505 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That movie makes me feel guilty.
L42504 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
L42503 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
L42502 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
L42483 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
L42482 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
L42481 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh!
L42474 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
L42473 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Stop it, Alvy!
L42470 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
L42469 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
L42468 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
L42467 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The alarm clock.
L42466 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ How can you possibly oversleep?
L42465 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I missed my therapy. I overslept.
L42458 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, stop listening to him.
L42457 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
L42455 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
L42454 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
L42453 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
L42452 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
L42451 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
L42450 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
L42449 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
L42447 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
L42446 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
L42445 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
L42444 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
L42443 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Two minutes, Alvy.
L42439 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
L42438 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
L42437 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
L42436 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
L42435 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
L42434 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
L42433 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
L42432 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
L43057 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
L43056 +++$+++ u3689 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
L43055 +++$+++ u3689 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Can I confess something?
L43054 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
L43053 +++$+++ u3689 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ This is my room.
L43052 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
L43051 +++$+++ u3689 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Alvy.
L42374 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
L42373 +++$+++ u3697 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TEACHER +++$+++ Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
L42370 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I did.
L42369 +++$+++ u3697 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TEACHER +++$+++ Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
L42368 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
L42367 +++$+++ u3697 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TEACHER +++$+++ You should be ashamed of yourself.
L42366 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What'd I do?
L42365 +++$+++ u3697 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TEACHER +++$+++ Step up here!
L42364 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What'd I do?
L42657 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
L42656 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L42655 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Jesus!
L42654 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Oswald and ghosts.
L42653 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Bad?
L42652 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I have a headache.
L42651 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, you got a headache!
L42650 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ My head is throbbing.
L42649 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What-
L42648 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't.
L42647 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
L42646 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
L42645 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
L42644 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
L42643 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
L42642 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Dammit! I was so close.
L42641 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Don't get upset!
L42640 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry!
L42639 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
L42638 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ "Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
L42637 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
L42634 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
L42633 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
L42632 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
L42631 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Here you are. There's people out there.
L42629 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No jokes-these are friends, okay?
L42628 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
L42627 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Commentary.
L42626 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
L42625 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
L42624 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ 'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
L42623 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why are you so hostile?
L42622 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
L43188 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
L43187 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ Who said that?
L43186 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
L43185 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ I mean that as a compliment.
L43184 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
L43183 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
L43182 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
L43181 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
L43180 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
L43179 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
L43178 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
L43177 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ Yeah.
L43176 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Are you?
L43175 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
L43174 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
L43173 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
L43172 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I can think of another word.
L43171 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
L43170 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch, a few.
L43169 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ You have a raccoon?
L43168 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
L43167 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ You catch Dylan?
L43166 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Man, that's great. That's just great.
L42496 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tell him.
L42495 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ Oh.
L42494 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
L42493 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ Yes.
L42492 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, do yuh?
L42491 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
L42490 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
L42489 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
L42487 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ ...as opposed to a print...
L42486 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
L42485 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
L42484 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
L42480 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
L42479 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ It's a narrow view.
L42478 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Probably on their first date, right?
L42472 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
L42471 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
L42464 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What are you depressed about?
L42463 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ without getting... well, let's put it this way...
L42462 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Key word here is "indulgent."
L42461 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
L42460 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
L42459 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
L43535 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I love it there.
L43534 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
L43531 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Right before his un-American thing.
L43530 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey.
L43529 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Charlie Chaplin.
L43528 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Trigger.
L43527 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
L43345 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
L43344 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
L43607 +++$+++ u3690 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ GIRL DATE +++$+++ You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
L43606 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Mean?
L43605 +++$+++ u3690 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ GIRL DATE +++$+++ Whatta you mean?
L43604 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Sixteen years ago.

L43602 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
L43601 +++$+++ u3690 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ GIRL DATE +++$+++ What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
L43651 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.

L43659 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
L43658 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Max, are we driving through plutonium?
L43657 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
L43656 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
L43655 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
L43654 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
L43653 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
L43516 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We're gonna operate together.
L43515 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
L43514 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah. Right.
L43513 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
L43510 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hi. How do you do.
L43509 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
L43508 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
L43503 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
L43502 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
L43501 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
L43500 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
L43499 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ How do you like this couple, Max?
L43498 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ And... uh-
L43497 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ M'hm.
L43496 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
L43495 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ There are no twos, Max.
L43494 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
L43493 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
L43492 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ V.P.L.?
L43491 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ The one with the V.P.L.
L43490 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Where?
L43489 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
L43488 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I think he has a little thing for Annie.
L43487 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What difference does that make?
L43486 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
L43485 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
L43484 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'hm.
L43483 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You like this house, Max?
L43459 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
L43458 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ How about a ginger ale?
L43457 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
L43456 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You wanna lie down?
L43455 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know, I mean, I-
L43454 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You all right?
L43453 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.
L43452 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well, sit down.
L43451 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
L43450 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What's the matter?
L43444 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
L43443 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
L43442 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We do the show live in front of an audience.
L43441 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Look, uh...
L43440 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
L43436 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
L43435 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, I've got a hit series.
L43434 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Do you realize how immoral this all is?
L43431 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
L43430 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh.
L43428 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
L43427 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
L43426 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
L43425 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
L43278 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
L43277 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
L43276 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I have some very good memories there.
L43272 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
L43271 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
L43270 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
L43269 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We can show her the schoolyard.
L43268 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
L43265 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You'll total the whole car.
L43264 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, watch the road!
L42665 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
L42664 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
L42663 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
L42662 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
L42661 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
L42660 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, the city is terribly worried.
L42659 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
L42658 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
L42401 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
L42400 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
L42399 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
L42398 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
L42397 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Forget it, Max.
L42396 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
L42395 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Ah.
L42394 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right, Max. California, Max.
L42393 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
L42392 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
L42391 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Stop calling me Max.
L42390 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Ah, Max, you, uh...
L42389 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
L42388 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
L42387 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
L42386 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You're crazy!
L42385 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
L43289 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
L43288 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
L43287 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ All right-so we can afford it.
L43286 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ Who's persecuting? She stole!
L43285 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ They're persecuted enough!
L43284 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ She was going through my pocketbook!
L43283 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ So the colored have enough trouble.
L43282 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ SO?
L43281 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ But she's colored.
L43280 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ She was stealing.
L43279 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ You fired the cleaning woman?
L43031 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
L43030 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ His wife has diabetes!
L43029 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
L42610 +++$+++ u3687 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
L42609 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
L42599 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...
L42598 +++$+++ u3687 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE +++$+++ I look pretty.
L42597 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
L42596 +++$+++ u3687 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Then there was Jerry, the actor.
L42595 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
L42594 +++$+++ u3687 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
L42593 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
L43562 +++$+++ u3685 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
L43561 +++$+++ u3688 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
L43560 +++$+++ u3685 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
L43559 +++$+++ u3688 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
L43558 +++$+++ u3685 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
L43557 +++$+++ u3688 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
L43068 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I just have time to get the, uh-
L43067 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ M'mmm.
L43064 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ We're going to take them to the airport.
L43063 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You think so? Do you really?
L43062 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
L43059 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.
L43058 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ Now, don't let it be so long, now.
L43045 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes, I do.
L43044 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ Oh, you remember her, Annie.
L43043 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
L43027 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, yes, yes.
L43026 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
L43020 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We really had a good time.
L43019 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
L43545 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ And here, you just-
L43544 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43543 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ It could be freezing, it could be raining.
L43542 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43541 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
