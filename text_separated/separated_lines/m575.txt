L616032 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Baloney!
L616031 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
L616030 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Will you leave me alone?
L616029 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
L616028 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ --and I can tell you where to get off.
L616027 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Oh--a hundred times--
L616026 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I didn't ask you to come away with me--
L616025 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
L616024 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
L616023 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
L616022 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
L616021 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
L616017 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
L616016 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I can explain--
L616015 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
L616008 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
L616007 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I'll join you later.
L616006 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Well--shall we go into dinner?
L616005 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
L616004 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ This is Miss Marsh.
L616003 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Hope we're not intruding.
L615889 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
L615888 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
L615661 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
L615660 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
L615659 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
L615658 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I never want to go back....
L615657 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Sure!
L615656 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
L615655 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ How'd you ever get away with it?
L615654 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
L615653 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
L615652 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ It would be a nice change from you.
L615651 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Do you want the truth, Anya?
L615650 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
L615649 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
L615648 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
L615647 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Anya, I think you're crazy.
L615640 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
L615639 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Anya!
L616287 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
L616286 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
L616132 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
L616131 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Isn't she lovely?
L616093 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Thanks.
L616092 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ We'll save you a place at our table.
L616091 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
L615891 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ That's a date. 
L615890 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I hope so.
L615886 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Glad to see you again.
L615885 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Good afternoon--
L615821 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
L615820 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
L615817 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
L615816 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Feeling a little better, I see.
L615689 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
L615688 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
L616013 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I think you do.
L616012 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L616011 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
L616010 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Sorry I can't return the compliment.
L616009 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
L615819 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
L615818 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
L616189 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Where's Lother?
L616188 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ No-o!
L616187 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
L616186 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Did you find it?
L616148 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
L616147 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
L616019 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ <U>Gladly</U>.
L616018 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Will you pardon me?
L615893 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
L615892 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ You'll excuse me. 
L615879 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Isn't that interesting?
L615878 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ --that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
L615672 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
L615671 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Montana?
L615670 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
L616450 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Get moving--
L616449 +++$+++ u8466 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BALLINGER +++$+++ Guess again, copper.
L616448 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
L616447 +++$+++ u8466 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BALLINGER +++$+++ Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
L616446 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ What did you want a gun for?
L616445 +++$+++ u8466 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BALLINGER +++$+++ Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
L616444 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Where'd you get it?
L616377 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
L616376 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
L616373 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
L616372 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
L616371 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
L616368 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
L616367 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ No gentleman would do that.
L616352 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sure!  Excuse me.
L616351 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Could I see you a minute?
L616088 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Fine--I'll be glad to.
L616087 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ How about a little game later?
L615925 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
L615924 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ You're coming back--
L615915 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ And me coming in with two pair-- 
L615914 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Aces full.
L615911 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll bet a couple of hundred.
L615910 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
L615903 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
L615902 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
L615897 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Not at all.
L615896 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
L615693 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ We'll be expecting you.
L615692 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
L616523 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What's the matter?
L616522 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Well, I'll be--!!!
L616521 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Jimmy!
L616520 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
L616425 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll be waiting on deck.
L616424 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
L616423 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Make it five.
L616422 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
L616309 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Come on--let's take a swim.
L616308 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
L616307 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
L616306 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
L616305 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You can live that down, can't you?
L616304 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
L616303 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ What do you know about them?
L616302 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
L616301 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Lose?--I won a little--
L616300 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
L616299 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
L616298 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Who with?
L616297 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
L616296 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ How well do you know her?
L616295 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yes--I remember--
L616294 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
L616293 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I could see you were pining away--
L616235 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Good night, idiot!
L616234 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Good night, Mrs. Brett!
L616221 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I think we ought to walk.
L616220 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
L616219 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
L616218 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
L616217 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
L616216 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
L616215 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What?--
L616214 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
L616213 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What, again?
L616201 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We'll let it go at that--
L616200 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Lonesome?
L616199 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ This time I'm really glad you showed up.
L616198 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
L616197 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
L616077 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You said it! How about a little action?
L616076 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Don't let's talk about it.
L616075 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You mean that?
L616074 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
L616073 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sally--!
L616072 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ --I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
L616071 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ But--
L616070 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
L616069 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
L616068 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
L616066 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
L616065 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
L616064 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
L616063 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ A lot of things I'd like to forget.
L616062 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What are you thinking?
L616061 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
L616060 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Mighty decent of you, pal.
L616059 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
L616058 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Thanks.
L616057 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sorry.
L616056 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ A little.
L616054 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
L616053 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.

L615843 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
L615835 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
L615834 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
L615833 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Okay.
L615832 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sooner it you like.

L615828 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Don't rub it in.
L615827 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, I can't.
L615826 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Yes?
L615825 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You asked me to dine with you tonight.
L615824 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Don't be a c-a-t.
L615823 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Very--your mother?
L615822 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Isn't she attractive?
L615808 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ --you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
L615807 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
L615806 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Tell me.
L615805 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
L615804 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
L615803 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
L615802 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Married?
L615801 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
L615800 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
L615799 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
L615798 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
L615797 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
L615769 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
L615768 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Brett is the name.

L615760 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
L615759 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You work too fast for me, young man.
L615758 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
L615757 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're not very ambitious, are you?
L615756 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
L615706 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
L615705 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ --sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
L615704 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ There's soft music--
L615703 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Good-by!
L615702 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
L615701 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Good-by.
L615700 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ How about giving me another coat?
L615699 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ So you washed it off!
L615698 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
L615697 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
L615696 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Where have you been hiding?
L615478 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
L615477 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ --You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
L615476 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I could stand some more--
L615475 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You've got lipstick all over you.
L615474 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Very much--
L615473 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Like her paint job?
L615472 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Yes--
L615471 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Nice lines--
L615470 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll say she is!
L615469 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
L615468 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
L615467 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yes--are you?
L615466 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
L615465 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I thought you were one of my friends.
L615464 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Want to take it back?
L615463 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm so sorry!
L616508 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Get it!
L616507 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ On the drunk.
L616506 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Where did you hide it?
L616505 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
L616504 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
L616503 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
L616268 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
L616267 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Say--wait a minute!
L616266 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
L616265 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ <U>Me</U>!
L616264 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You keep it-- 
L615934 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
L615933 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Partners, ain't we?
L615932 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ About sixteen hundred.
L615923 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
L615922 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
L615921 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ What is it?
L615920 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
L615908 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll take one. 
L615907 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Thank you, sir. 
L615906 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
L615905 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
L615884 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
L615883 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
L615876 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
L615875 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
L615874 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ They won't squawk--they're professionals.
L615858 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
L615857 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ You take some awful chances.
L615856 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
L615855 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
L615854 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
L615853 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Are you screwy?
L615852 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Inspector McKinney.
L615577 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Now you're talkin'!
L615576 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
L615575 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
L615574 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Shortie!--you know my motto?
L615569 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
L615568 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Change?
L615567 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ My change.
L615566 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ No, sir?
L615565 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
L615561 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
L615560 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
L615559 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
L615558 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ This is a business trip!
L615557 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
L615556 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ --there's thousands of 'em!
L615555 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
L615554 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
L615553 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
L615552 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
L615551 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
L615550 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Not a chance.
L615549 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
L615548 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ A dollar forty.
L615547 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ How're the tips?
L615546 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
L615545 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
L615544 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
L615448 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
L615447 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ You don't think--?
L615440 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Shortie, look!
L615439 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
L615435 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
L615434 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
L615427 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ I'll watch for him, sir.
L615426 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
L615425 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
L615424 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Nix, the law!
L615423 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
L615422 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
L615421 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
L615420 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
L615419 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
L615418 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
L615417 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ We coulda got two third-class!
L615416 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
L615415 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
L615414 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I thought you were a smart guy.
L615413 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
L615412 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
L615411 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Not here--follow me around the shed.
L616375 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
L616374 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ That goes two ways.
L616370 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Think again--
L616369 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ I thought you were a sucker--
L616366 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why isn't that a good time to quit?
L616365 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
L616364 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
L616086 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Much better--thank you--
L616085 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ How's your mother feeling?
L615918 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ It's a pleasure.
L615917 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ It's your deal.
L615901 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
L615900 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Three Jacks.
L615899 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
L615898 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
L615881 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
L615880 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Come in! 
L616527 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Thanks. That makes us square.
L616526 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Here's your fifty.
L616485 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why, I--
L616484 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
L616476 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
L616475 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Don't get yourself all worked up--
L616464 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
L616463 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
L616350 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
L616349 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
L616346 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ It's a bet--come on, Sally!
L616345 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
L616273 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
L616272 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Coming to the pool for a swim?
L616271 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Hello, young fellow!
L616249 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?
L616248 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Hey!--you're tickling me.
L616247 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
L616246 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ How about trying your fine Italian hand?
L616245 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
L616243 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Swell!
L616242 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I'll go with you.
L616241 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sure, I'll go.
L616240 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
L616239 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why?
L616238 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
L616237 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
L616236 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ How about you?
L616231 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
L616230 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
L616183 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Good night!
L616182 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
L616181 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
L616177 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I wouldn't be surprised--
L616176 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
L616175 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
L616174 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
L616173 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
L616172 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
L616146 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
L616145 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Care to join us?
L616110 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I'll go with you--
L616109 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'm going to the show--
L615774 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ No--not quite.
L615773 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
L615772 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Before that. Your face is very familiar.
L615771 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, yes. On the pier.
L615770 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
L616502 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
L616501 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ What's that?
L616500 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
L616499 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
L616498 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
L616497 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ She did?
L616496 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
L616047 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
L616046 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I should say not.
L616045 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
L615989 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
L615988 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
L615987 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
L615986 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
L615840 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
L615839 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Wait a minute--let's match for it.
L615838 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ That's all right. I'll attend to this.
L615786 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
L615785 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
L615784 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ That's too bad.
L615781 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ O.K. Heads you win.
L615780 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
L615779 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
L615776 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
L615775 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
L615753 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
L615752 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
L615751 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Sure.
L615750 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
L615749 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ O.K.! Send that!
L615748 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
L615747 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ June? That's my wife's name.
L615746 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
L615745 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Next month is June.
L615744 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
L615743 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Send that.
L615742 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
L615741 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Cut it out.
L615740 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Sure.
L615739 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Your wife knows that, don't she?
L615738 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Back is in New York.
L615737 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
L615736 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
L615735 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
L615734 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
L615733 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ "Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
L615732 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How?
L615731 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
L615730 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
L615729 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ "Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
L615728 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
L615727 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Sure.
L615726 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Your wife knows that, don't she?
L615725 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ In New York.
L615724 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Where do you live?
L615723 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How?
L615722 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
L615717 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ What'll I say?
L615716 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Here you are, sir. 
L616341 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
L616340 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I was never stiffer in my life.
L616339 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
L616338 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Who won?
L616337 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
L615719 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ That's fine.
L615718 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
L615715 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ She's in New York.
L615714 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
L615713 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
L615712 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
L615711 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
L615710 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Well, did you find me?
L615709 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
L615708 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I thought I put you to bed.
L615707 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hello, Denby!
L615530 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ <U>Nuts</U> to you too!
L615529 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I can see where I won't talk much to you.
L615526 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ So what?
L615525 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yes--Me--in person!
L615524 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
L615523 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ That's me!
L615520 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I can see you're no gentleman--
L615519 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Knots!
L615518 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ What?
L615517 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No. <U>Knots</U>!
L615516 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
L615515 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
L615514 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
L615982 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Never mind.
L615981 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
L615980 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
L615979 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
L615978 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, there you are--
L615522 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ <U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
L615521 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
L616483 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yes!
L616482 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Is this your gun?
L616481 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
L616480 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
L616479 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I didn't--
L616283 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Yeah--
L616282 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Maybe he just travels in bad company.
L616281 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
L616280 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
L616279 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
L616278 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
L616277 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
L616276 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
L615849 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
L615848 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
L615847 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
L615846 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
L615845 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
L615815 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
L615814 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
L615811 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
L615810 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
L615809 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
L615766 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Miss Marsh.
L615765 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ McKinney's the name.
L616402 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
L616401 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why--don't you like him?
L616400 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Very--
L616399 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Very serious?
L616398 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yes.
L615793 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ <U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
L615792 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I don't get the humor of that remark.
L615791 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
L615790 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
L615622 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
L615621 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
L615620 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I'll never love anybody else.
L615619 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
L615618 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ But not nice enough to marry--eh?
L615617 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
L615616 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
L615615 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
L615614 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
L615613 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
L615612 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
L615611 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
L615610 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
L615609 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
L615608 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Do what--
L615607 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
L615606 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
L615605 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
L615604 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--not much--excepting-- 
L615603 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
L615602 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
L615601 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And you've put it over--haven't you?
L615600 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
L615599 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
L615598 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Like it?
L615597 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
L615596 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Just what the doctor ordered.
L615595 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Everything O.K.?
L615594 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
L615593 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
L615592 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Am I a member of this club?
L615395 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
L615394 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Are you happy?
L615393 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
L616411 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ You don't shoot squirrels.
L616410 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Meaning what?
L616409 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
L616408 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
L616407 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
L616406 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ What do you mean?
L616405 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
L616533 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Good-night, folks.
L616532 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
L616123 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
L616122 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
L615984 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
L615983 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
L615513 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
L615512 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is that one of the Who's Who?
L615511 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
L615510 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
L615509 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
L615508 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Get that out of your trunk.
L615507 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ So what?
L615506 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ --And he has sex appeal.
L615505 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
L615504 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well, he has a straw hat--
L615503 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What's he got that I haven't got?
L615502 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
L615501 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
L615500 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ With your dry wit and humor--
L615352 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
L615351 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
L615350 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
L615349 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
L615348 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
L615347 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
L615345 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
L615344 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
L615343 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
L615342 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm getting seasick--
L615341 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What's the matter, Mary?
L615340 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
L615339 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Very good, Mary--
L615338 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
L615337 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Well, let's hear the poem--
L615336 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Somebody's got to do it--
L615335 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
L615334 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
L615333 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
L616210 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
L616209 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
L616208 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What for?
L616207 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
L616206 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What happened to you?
L615591 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
L615590 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
L615589 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
L615588 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
L615929 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
L615928 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I went for four.
L615927 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ About twelve hundred.
L615926 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ How much did you lose?
L615913 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
L615912 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
L615871 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
L615870 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ The country boy's about due.
L615869 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
L615868 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
L615867 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Can you read 'em Jack?
L615680 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
L615679 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ That's him! That's the sucker!!
L615676 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
L615675 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
L615674 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Eh?... Oh.
L615673 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
L616419 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Not a chance--I'm through. 
L616418 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
L616196 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
L616195 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
L616194 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
L616193 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
L616192 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
L615999 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
L615998 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Don't, Lee--that's dead.
L615997 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
L615996 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ --and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
L615995 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
L615994 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
L615976 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You can't bluff me any more.
L615975 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
L615974 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Not because of Ned.
L615971 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
L615970 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ --you'd go with him!
L615969 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
L615968 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You leave the kid alone.
L615967 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Thanks to me.
L615966 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's all right.
L615965 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
L615964 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
L615963 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
L615962 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I wish I could.
L615961 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
L615960 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why don't you leave me alone?
L615959 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
L615958 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
L615957 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
L615956 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
L616478 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
L616477 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
L616474 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Because I was yellow, I guess--
L616473 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Why?
L616472 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
L616471 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
L616470 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ No!
L616469 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
L616468 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Yes, Yes!
L616529 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
L616528 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
L616519 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
L616518 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
L616517 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
L616462 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
L616461 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
L616460 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I sincerely hope so--
L616459 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ That's the truth--every single word!
L616361 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
L616360 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
L616359 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
L616358 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
L616357 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I mean if you knew it were stolen.
L616356 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Say, "Thanks very much!"
L616355 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
L616354 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
L616353 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Congratulations.
L616233 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Good night!
L616232 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
L616258 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
L616257 +++$+++ u8474 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ PURSER +++$+++ What's the matter?
L616256 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
L616255 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ It all depends on what you're used to.
L616254 +++$+++ u8474 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ PURSER +++$+++ I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
L616253 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ "Smooth's" the word.
L616252 +++$+++ u8474 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ PURSER +++$+++ He's certainly good-natured.
