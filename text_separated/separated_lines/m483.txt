L456021 +++$+++ u7183 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ 1ST EMBALMER +++$+++ That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
L456020 +++$+++ u7184 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ 2ND EMBALMER +++$+++ Did I?
L456019 +++$+++ u7183 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ 1ST EMBALMER +++$+++ You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
L456018 +++$+++ u7184 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ 2ND EMBALMER +++$+++ Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
L456017 +++$+++ u7183 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ 1ST EMBALMER +++$+++ By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
L456118 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ [Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
L456117 +++$+++ u7185 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ 2ND OFFICER +++$+++ Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
L456116 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Did she talk?
L456115 +++$+++ u7185 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ 2ND OFFICER +++$+++ Just before she died she came to--
L456114 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
L456113 +++$+++ u7185 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ 2ND OFFICER +++$+++ Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
L456267 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
L456266 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
L456265 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
L456264 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
L456263 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
L456262 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
L456261 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
L456260 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
L456259 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Then you knew of the inheritance?
L456258 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ [Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
L456257 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ So--friendly or otherwise--?
L456256 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
L456255 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Gosh, you had me fooled.
L456228 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Okay--I'll be here at eight.
L456227 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
L456226 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
L456225 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
L456224 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
L456223 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
L456222 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's inherited a fortune.
L456221 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Indeed, he has often told me.
L456220 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
L456219 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
L456218 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You mean he doesn't work for you?
L456216 +++$+++ u7186 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
L456215 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Did you wish to see someone?
L456125 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
L456124 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
L456123 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Dr. Meirschultz, too?
L456122 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
L456121 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
L456112 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
L456111 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
L456106 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ I don't know--I can't tell--
L456105 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
L456104 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ You--a friend to me?
L456103 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
L456102 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ Maybe you want my money, too.
L456101 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
L456100 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
L456099 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ What made you steal? Are you hungry?
L456097 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ I don't know, [I tell you].
L456096 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Who are you? What is your name?
L456095 +++$+++ u7187 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ BUCKLEY +++$+++ No-
L456132 +++$+++ u7188 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ COLLINS +++$+++ Why didn't you notify the police?
L456131 +++$+++ u7193 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
L456130 +++$+++ u7188 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ COLLINS +++$+++ Maybe you're right.
L456129 +++$+++ u7193 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
L456128 +++$+++ u7188 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ COLLINS +++$+++ That sounds to me very remarkable.
L456127 +++$+++ u7193 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
L456149 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
L456148 +++$+++ u7189 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ GOOF +++$+++ Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
L456146 +++$+++ u7189 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ GOOF +++$+++ You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
L456145 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ But where do the rats come in?
L456144 +++$+++ u7189 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ GOOF +++$+++ That's it. You get it quick.
L456143 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
L456142 +++$+++ u7189 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ GOOF +++$+++ Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
L456141 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
L456140 +++$+++ u7189 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ GOOF +++$+++ Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
L456139 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Thousands?
L456138 +++$+++ u7189 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ GOOF +++$+++ Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
L456137 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ [Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
L456136 +++$+++ u7189 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ GOOF +++$+++ He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
L456135 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
L456279 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Come on, we're wasting time.
L456278 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
L456277 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
L456276 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
L456275 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Take me down there.
L456274 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
L456273 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ What's that?
L456272 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
L456271 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
L456270 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ You here again?
L456242 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ I'd like to have a look.
L456241 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
L456240 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ What's down there?
L456239 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
L456238 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
L456237 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Do you have many patients, doctor?
L456236 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
L456235 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
L456234 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
L456233 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
L456232 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
L456231 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
L456230 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Well, news of Buckley?
L456229 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ How do you do.
L456157 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
L456156 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
L456153 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ You found Buckley?
L456152 +++$+++ u7190 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
L456253 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
L456252 +++$+++ u7192 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MRS. BUCKLEY +++$+++ It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
L456251 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ [Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
L456250 +++$+++ u7192 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MRS. BUCKLEY +++$+++ How? What can I do?
L456249 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
L456213 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
L456212 +++$+++ u7192 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MRS. BUCKLEY +++$+++ You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
L456080 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
L456079 +++$+++ u7192 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MRS. BUCKLEY +++$+++ I'm going to call the police.
L456078 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L456032 +++$+++ u7191 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MAXWELL +++$+++ He isn't here.
L456031 +++$+++ u7192 +++$+++ m483 +++$+++ MRS. BUCKLEY +++$+++ Dr. Meirschultz, please.
