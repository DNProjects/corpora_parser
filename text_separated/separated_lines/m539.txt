L555394 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ Roll 'em.
L555393 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
L555392 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
L555346 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
L555345 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ I hear she was a terror to work with.
L555344 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
L555343 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ I didn't mean to --
L555342 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
L555341 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
L555340 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
L555339 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
L555338 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
L555287 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
L555286 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
L555261 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
L555260 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
L555259 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
L555161 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
L555160 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
L555154 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
L555153 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'll take it.
L555152 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
L555151 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
L555150 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Sure, this'll go on all night.
L555149 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
L555148 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
L555147 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good party.
L555146 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Where's the bar?
L555145 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
L555144 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Close, but no cigar.
L555143 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
L555141 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Come on.
L555140 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That was the general idea.
L555139 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ You're going to stay, aren't you?
L555138 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Let it ride for a while.
L555137 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Give me your coat.
L555136 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
L555135 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ In a deep freeze.
L555134 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
L555133 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hi, Artie.
L555132 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
L554838 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
L554837 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
L554831 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I just think pictures should say a little something.
L554830 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Name dropper.
L554826 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
L554825 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ This is Miss Kramer.
L554824 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
L554823 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
L554822 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Nothing for Ladd?
L554821 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's from hunger.
L554820 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What's wrong with it?
L554819 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
L555595 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Nobody asked you to.
L555594 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Joe, I can't look at you any more.
L555593 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
L555592 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you love me, Joe.
L555591 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
L555590 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Come on, Joe.
L555589 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
L555588 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
L555587 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
L555586 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No.
L555585 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
L555584 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
L555583 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Her own movie theatre.
L555582 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
L555581 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why did she call me?
L555580 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
L555579 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
L555578 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
L555577 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Whose?
L555576 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hers.
L555575 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Whose house is it?
L555574 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You bet.
L555573 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This is where you live?
L555572 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
L555571 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Come on in, Betty,
L555570 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
L555569 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hello, Betty.
L555546 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You did.
L555545 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What happened?
L555544 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
L555543 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why not? Don't you love Artie?
L555542 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't want it now.
L555541 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
L555540 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
L555539 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
L555538 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ From Artie.  What's wrong?
L555537 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
L555536 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
L555534 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.
L555533 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I just don't.
L555532 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why not?
L555531 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
L555530 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
L555529 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Was I?  I'm sorry.
L555528 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
L555513 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
L555512 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Twenty-two.
L555511 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
L555510 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It must be my new shampoo.
L555509 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ May I say you smell real special.
L555508 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you please.
L555507 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
L555506 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
L555505 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
L555504 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
L555503 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Saddest thing I ever heard.
L555502 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
L555501 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Nice job.
L555500 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
L555499 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Second generation, huh?
L555498 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
L555497 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What were you -- a child actress?
L555496 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
L555494 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
L555493 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
L555492 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
L555491 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'll say.  This is solid gold.
L555490 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
L555489 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
L555488 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Who's who?
L555487 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Who's Norma?
L555486 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
L555485 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
L555484 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
L555483 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It will?
L555482 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
L555481 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
L555480 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good.
L555437 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
L555436 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, you --
L555434 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
L555433 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ So do I.
L555432 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
L555431 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
L555430 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Honest to goodness, I hate you.
L555429 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
L555428 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're tough, all right.
L555427 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
L555426 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Nobody can be that busy.
L555425 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's just impossible.
L555424 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
L555423 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
L555422 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We're engaged.
L555421 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What has Artie to do with it.
L555420 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
L555419 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm all tied up.  I can't.
L555418 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
L555417 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sorry.  It's your baby now.
L555416 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'll make it short.
L555415 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
L555414 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
L555413 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Check.
L555412 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
L555411 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
L555410 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
L555409 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What about all those ideas you had?
L555408 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
L555407 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
L555406 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why should you do that?
L555405 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
L555403 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well, for heaven's sake!
L555402 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
L555291 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ So long.
L555290 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You sure have.
L555289 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sorry if I crossed you up.
L555288 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
L555283 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
L555282 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I tell you this is half sold.
L555281 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
L555278 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
L555277 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I was afraid of that.
L555276 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
L555275 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ O.K.  Where's the cash?
L555272 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
L555271 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Into what? A lampshade?
L555270 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He thinks it could be made into something.
L555269 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You did?
L555268 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
L555267 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What teacher?
L555266 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
L555265 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
L555264 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
L555263 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
L555262 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
L555258 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You don't know how glad I am to see youl
L555257 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
L555204 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Life can be beautiful!
L555203 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ With a wildly beating heart.
L555202 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You'll be waiting for me?
L555201 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
L555200 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
L555199 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
L555196 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Phillip, you're mad!
L555195 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
L555194 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you hungry?
L555193 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
L555192 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
L555191 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Well....
L555190 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ As for instance?
L555189 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
L555188 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
L555187 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
L555186 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
L555185 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Who wants true? Who wants moving?
L555184 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
L555183 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I had a teacher like that once.
L555182 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
L555181 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
L555178 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How about the Rainbow Room?
L555177 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Is there someplace we can talk?
L555176 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
L555175 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thank you.
L555174 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I didn't.
L555173 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
L555172 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's one called....Window... something with a window.
L555171 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why, you sweet kid.
L555170 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
L555169 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
L555168 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I've been hoping to run into you.
L555167 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thanks.
L555166 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You forgot this.
L555163 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
L555162 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hurt feelings department.
L555159 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure.  Bases Loaded.
L555158 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
L554836 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
L554835 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
L554834 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
L554829 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
L554828 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
L554827 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ If I could be of any help...
L555443 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
L555442 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
L555381 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
L555380 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
L555364 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
L555363 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
L555362 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Gordon Cole?
L555361 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
L555360 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ What assistant?
L555359 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
L555358 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L555357 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
L555356 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
L555355 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You'd better.  I'm very angry.
L555354 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
L555353 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
L555352 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
L555351 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Hello, Mr. deMille.
L555350 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Hello, young fellow.
L555391 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
L555390 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
L555389 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
L555388 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
L555387 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It's a good script, isn't it?
L555386 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ That's what I want to talk to you about.
L555385 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
L555384 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ We've missed you too, dear.
L555383 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
L555382 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ What's the matter, Norma?
L555630 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
L555629 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Goodbye.  Norma.
L555628 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'm the greatest star of them all.
L555627 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
L555626 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You heard him.  I'm a star!
L555624 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That isn't true! Max?
L555623 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
L555622 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
L555621 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
L555620 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Wanted what?
L555619 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
L555618 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What about the studio? What about De Mille?
L555617 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ No, they don't.
L555616 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That's a lie!  They still want me!
L555615 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
L555614 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
L555613 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
L555612 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
L555611 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You think I made that up about the gun...
L555610 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's between you and yourself, Norma.
L555609 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
L555608 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
L555607 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
L555606 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
L555605 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
L555604 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
L555603 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
L555602 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No, you're not.  Max! Max!
L555601 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Yes, I am, Norma.
L555600 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
L555473 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
L555472 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I haven't done anything, Norma.
L555471 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
L555470 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
L555469 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No you didn't.  You took the car.
L555468 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I went for a walk.
L555467 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
L555466 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L555465 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
L555464 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I think I'll read a little.
L555463 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You'd better get to bed yourself.
L555462 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good.
L555461 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
L555460 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good.
L555459 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
L555458 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good night.
L555457 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
L555456 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Yes, Norma.
L555455 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
L555449 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
L555448 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ He must be quite a guy.
L555447 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
L555446 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How did it go?
L555349 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Thank you, darling.
L555348 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
L555347 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't you want to come along, darling?
L555317 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
L555316 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Maybe deMille is shooting.
L555315 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
L555302 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
L555301 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
L555300 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
L555296 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Where are your...?
L555295 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Where are my cigarettes?
L555294 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I ran into some people I knew.
L555293 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
L555252 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You're a darling.
L555251 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
L555250 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They're awful.  They make me cough.
L555249 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Have one of mine.
L555246 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
L555245 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ When did he say it, Norma?
L555244 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
L555243 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
L555242 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
L555241 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Did she read the script?
L555240 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ This is the right day.
L555239 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You're really going to send it to De Mille?
L555225 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
L555224 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
L555223 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
L555222 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
L555221 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
L555220 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Great stars have great pride.
L555219 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
L555218 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
L555217 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
L555216 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Go away.
L555130 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
L555129 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
L555128 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
L555127 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
L555126 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What right? Do you want me to tell you?
L555125 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What right do you have to take me for granted?
L555124 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L555123 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Cut out that us business.
L555122 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
L555121 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Keep it.
L555120 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
L555119 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
L555118 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ "Mad about the boy."
L555117 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What are the notes?
L555111 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
L555110 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What's that?
L555109 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
L555108 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ A little.
L555107 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You think this is all very funny.
L555106 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
L555105 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Hold me tighter.
L555104 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
L555103 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
L555102 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ The other guests?
L555101 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who?
L555100 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
L555099 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's those feathers.  They tickle.
L555098 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't bend back like that.
L555097 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Just follow me.
L555096 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Not on the same floor with Valentino!
L555093 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
L555092 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Shouldn't we wait for the others?
L555091 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
L555090 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
L555089 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
L555088 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
L555087 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Come here!
L555086 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
L555084 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Come on!
L555083 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ 
L555082 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
L555059 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
L555058 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Tails.  That's ridiculous.
L555057 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
L555056 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I don't need a tuxedo.
L555055 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ How about some evening clothes?
L555053 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
L555052 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
L555051 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
L555050 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What's wrong with It?
L555049 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
L555047 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
L555046 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
L555045 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
L555044 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I've lost my car.
L555043 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
L555040 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
L555039 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I need some money right now.
L555038 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
L555037 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ They've come for my car.
L555036 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
L555035 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I want to talk to you for a minute.
L555023 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Okay.
L555022 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
L555021 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
L555020 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Cut away from me?
L555019 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
L555018 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What scene?
L555017 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Just a scene I cut out.
L555016 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What's that?
L555014 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
L555013 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
L555012 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
L555011 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
L555010 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
L555009 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm used to paying my own bills.
L555008 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
L555007 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'll take care of that.
L555006 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
L555005 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
L555004 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You'll like it here.
L555003 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
L555002 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
L554978 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'll come early tomorrow.
L554977 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You can stay here.
L554976 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ There sure is.
L554975 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ There's something wrong with your car, you said.
L554974 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
L554973 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Where do you live?
L554972 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
L554971 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
L554970 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's getting kind of late --
L554969 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
L554968 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
L554967 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
L554966 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
L554965 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't care.
L554964 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
L554963 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I want you to do this work.
L554962 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thank you.
L554961 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
L554960 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ December twenty-first.
L554959 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What month?
L554958 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I don't know.
L554957 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
L554956 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
L554955 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I will not have it butchered.
L554954 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
L554953 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
L554952 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
L554951 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I wrote that with my heart.
L554950 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
L554949 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Of course it is.
L554948 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ This is fascinating.
L554947 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Well?
L554941 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I am not afraid.  Read it!
L554940 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
L554939 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
L554938 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ They'll love it in Pomona.
L554937 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
L554936 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Fair enough.
L554935 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
L554934 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
L554933 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who else ?
L554932 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And you'll play Salome?
L554931 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ We've made a lot of pictures together.
L554930 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L554929 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
L554928 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
L554927 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
L554926 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
L554925 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
L554924 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Or teach it a better tune.
L554923 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
L554921 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
L554920 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ And you have written pictures, haven't you?
L554919 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
L554918 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Are you or aren't you?
L554917 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why?
L554916 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You're a writer, you said.
L554915 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Yeah?
L554914 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Just a minute, you!
L554912 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Get out!
L554911 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
L554910 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
L554909 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
L554908 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
L554907 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
L554906 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
L554905 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I knew there was something wrong with them.
L554904 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
L554903 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
L554902 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Or shall I call my servant?
L554901 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
L554900 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Get out.
L554899 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
L554898 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It is not.  Get out.
L554897 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
L554896 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
L554895 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
L554893 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
L554892 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
L555525 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
L555524 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And she's turned you into a servant.
L555523 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
L555522 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You made her a star?
L555521 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
L555520 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
L555519 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
L555518 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
L555517 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
L555516 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
L555515 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
L555514 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
L555440 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What?
L555439 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
L555438 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What's the matter, Max?
L555398 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
L555397 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
L555396 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
L555285 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Right with you.
L555284 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Mr. Gillis, if you please.
L555214 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She is upstairs.
L555213 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How is she?
L555080 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
L555079 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
L555078 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
L555077 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You send them.  Is that it, Max?
L555076 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
L555075 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
L555074 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
L555073 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L555072 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
L555071 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What doctor?
L555070 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The doctor suggested it.
L555069 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How come?
L555068 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There are no locks anywhere in this house.
L555067 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
L555065 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
L555064 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Whose room was this?
L555033 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
L555032 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good.
L555031 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's what I told them.
L555030 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm not here.
L555029 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Some men are here.  They asked for you.
L555000 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
L554999 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
L554998 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Is that so!
L554997 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Naturally.  I brought them myself.
L554996 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
L554990 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You did, sir. GILLIS' VOICE He goes out.  Gillis     I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs   cuckoo, too.  A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair,   Come to think of it, the walks over to the win-   whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the      been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind.  creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks  beat with the rest of the down at:                 world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
L554989 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
L554988 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
L554987 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
L554986 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
L554985 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
L554984 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This room has not been used for a long time.
L554983 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
L554982 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I made your bed this afternoon.
L554887 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ For me?  Okay.
L554886 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Madame is waiting.
L554885 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Suppose you listen just for a minute -
L554882 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Dressed for what?
L554881 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You are not dressed properly.
L554880 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wipe your feet!
L554879 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
L554878 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Go on in.
L554877 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
L554808 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You say the cutest things.
L554807 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
L554806 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
L554805 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
L554804 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
L554803 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ Is that So?
L554802 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
L554796 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What car?
L554795 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ We've come for the car.
L554794 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's right.
L554793 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ Joseph C. Gillis?
L554853 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
L554852 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
L554851 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
L554850 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
L554849 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
L554848 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Haven't got a thing.
L554847 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Along is no good.  I need it now.
L554846 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
L554845 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
L554844 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
L554843 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Frankly, no.
L554842 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
L554841 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
L554840 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
L554833 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
L554832 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
L554817 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
L554816 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
L554815 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Got a title?
L554814 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
L554813 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
L554812 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
L554811 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
L554868 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ Maybe what you need is another agent.
L554867 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
L554866 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
L554865 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
L554864 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
L554863 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How's that about your being my friend?
L554862 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
L554861 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ No?
L554860 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
L555656 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
L555655 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
L555647 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
L555646 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
L555645 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
L555644 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ Had he been trying to blackmail you?
L555643 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
L555642 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
L555641 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
L555640 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
L555639 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
L555638 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
L555667 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ All right.  Camera!  Action!
L555666 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
L555665 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This is the staircase of the palace.
L555664 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What is the scene? Where am I?
L555652 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
L555651 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The cameras have arrived, Madame.
L555650 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
L555320 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Thank you, Max.
L555319 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
L555314 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Very good, Madam.
L555313 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
L555312 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
L555311 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
L555310 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
L555309 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
L555308 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Paramount studios.
L555307 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who?
L555306 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Paramount is calling.
L555305 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You know better than to interrupt me.
L555304 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Madame is wanted on the telephone.
L555238 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes, Madame.
L555237 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
L554944 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes.  Madame.
L554943 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Bring something to drink.
