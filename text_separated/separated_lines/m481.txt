L452744 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ What are you saying?
L452743 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
L452690 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
L452689 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Congratulations.
L452688 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
L452687 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
L452686 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
L452685 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
L452684 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
L452683 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
L452682 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
L452864 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ "Keep a shining in...
L452863 +++$+++ u7161 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM AND DRUNK +++$+++ "Honeymoon, honeymoon,

L453114 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
L453113 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Don't help me.
L453046 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
L453045 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
L453044 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What is it?
L453043 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Max, I...
L453015 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
L453014 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Liebkind, no!
L453013 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
L453008 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Shut up.
L453007 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ What???
L453006 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
L452964 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Double.  Double.  Double.
L452963 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
L452962 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I never should have listened to you.
L452957 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
L452956 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
L452894 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
L452893 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
L452892 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
L452891 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
L452890 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ No way out.  No way out.
L452889 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Maybe it's not true!
L452838 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ To failure!
L452837 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ To failure!
L452788 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
L452787 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
L452786 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ So much for Nutsy Fagin.
L452670 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
L452669 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
L452628 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Only if we ask him.
L452627 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Do you think he'll take the job?
L452626 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
L452625 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
L452624 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
L452623 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
L452622 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
L452621 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
L452605 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
L452604 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ What is she gonna do here?
L452603 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
L452602 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
L452594 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
L452593 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ What are you doing?
L452588 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
L452587 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
L452586 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Leo, what if this play is a hit?
L452585 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
L452584 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
L452583 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
L452534 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Okay, take it off, take it off.
L452533 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
L452532 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
L452495 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
L452494 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
L452434 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Who wrote it?
L452433 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
L452432 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ It won't run a week!
L452426 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
L452425 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You found a flop!
L452424 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
L452423 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
L452422 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
L452403 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
L452402 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
L452401 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
L452399 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
L452398 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
L452388 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
L452387 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Maybe you're happy.
L452386 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
L452385 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
L452383 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Two pistachios, my good man.
L452382 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
L452381 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What kind now, Leo?
L452377 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Then stick with Bialystock!
L452376 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Right.
L452375 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
L452374 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
L452373 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
L452372 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Coney Island??
L452371 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
L452370 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
L452369 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Where would you like to eat?
L452368 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh.
L452367 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I already have.  Come on.
L452366 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
L452365 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
L452364 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
L452347 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
L452346 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
L452345 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
L452344 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
L452343 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
L452342 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ How's this? 
L452341 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ It's a little better, but you still look angry.
L452340 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
L452339 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
L452338 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
L452332 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
L452331 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
L452330 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
L452329 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Will you get a hold on yourself.
L452328 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Aaaaaaaaaa!
L452327 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I'm not going to jump on you!
L452326 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
L452325 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What???
L452324 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
L452323 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You're going to jump on me.
L452322 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
L452321 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
L452318 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
L452317 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
L452316 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
L452311 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
L452310 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
L452309 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
L452308 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ What scheme?
L452307 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
L452306 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
L452305 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ But what if the play was a hit?
L452304 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
L452303 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ One night.
L452302 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Exactly.  And how long did it run?
L452301 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
L452300 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
L452299 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
L452298 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
L452297 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What did I do?
L452296 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
L452295 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What do you mean?
L452294 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
L452293 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Assume away!
L452290 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
L452289 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes, it's quite possible.
L452288 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
L452287 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ What was I saying?
L452286 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What you were saying.  Keep talking.
L452285 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes, what?
L452278 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
L452277 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
L452276 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
L452275 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
L452274 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh, it's all right ... wha?
L452273 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
L452272 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
L452271 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Help!
L452268 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
L452267 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ But that's cheating!
L452266 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
L452265 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
L452264 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
L452263 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
L452262 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Where?  What?
L452261 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
L452260 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
L452259 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mr. Bialystock ...
L452258 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
L452257 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
L452256 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Here, don't panic.
L452251 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ It's nothing ... nothing.
L452250 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What is that?  A handkerchief?
L452246 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
L452245 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
L452244 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
L452243 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Well, sir, it seems ...
L452242 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
L452241 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
L452240 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Good, what is it?
L452239 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I have hurt your feelings.
L452238 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
L452237 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
L452236 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
L452233 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
L452232 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Thank you.
L452231 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Do the books!  Do the books!
L452230 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
L452224 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
L452223 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ But sir, I'm not condem ...
L452217 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
L452216 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes sir.
L452212 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
L452211 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
L452210 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Scared.  Can't talk.
L452209 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
L452208 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
L452156 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Ooooooops.
L452155 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Oooooooops!
L452154 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'll wait in the hall ...
L452153 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
L452152 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
L452151 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
L453089 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
L453088 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Do you need us?
L453083 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
L453082 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Do it!  Do it!
L453072 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
L453071 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
L453068 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
L453067 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
L453066 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
L453049 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
L453048 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Come on.  Let's get going.
L453047 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
L453042 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
L453041 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
L453005 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
L453004 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
L453003 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Always.
L453002 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
L453001 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
L452998 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
L452997 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
L452990 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
L452989 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Not.
L452768 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
L452767 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
L452764 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't know.
L452763 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
L452762 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ But he has long hair!
L452761 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
L452760 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vaaaat???
L452735 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
L452734 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
L452493 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Good.  I will make the preparations.
L452492 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Yes.  We would!
L452491 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
L452490 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ We swear it!
L452489 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
L452485 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
L452484 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
L452483 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Really, I never dreamed ...
L452482 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
L452481 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ No kidding?
L452480 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
L452479 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ With whom?
L452478 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
L452463 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
L452462 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
L452461 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vat about it?
L452460 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Yes.
L452459 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
L452458 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
L452457 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
L452456 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
L452455 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
L452454 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
L452453 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
L452934 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
L452933 +++$+++ u7168 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ ULLA +++$+++ We make love?
L452636 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Very nice girl.

L452599 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
L452598 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
L452879 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
L452878 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.

L452191 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
L452190 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
L452189 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
L452184 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
L452183 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ I shall count the minutes.
L452182 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Like clockwork.
L452179 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
L452178 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
L452177 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
L452176 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
L452175 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.

L452170 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
L452169 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
L452168 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
