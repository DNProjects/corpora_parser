L462478 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
L462477 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Son--this is all happening so fast--
L462472 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't want to learn that!
L462471 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
L462468 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
L462467 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
L462464 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You don't want me to go.
L462463 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Will you wait a minute?
L462462 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Except yourself!
L462454 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Well--
L462453 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't think so--
L462450 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You what?
L462449 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
L462448 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You're absolutely right!
L462447 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
L462446 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Well, just get it off your chest, son.
L462440 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
L462439 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Will you let him tell it!
L462433 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I was in it.
L462432 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
L462431 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
L462430 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Go ahead.
L462352 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
L462351 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
L462350 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
L462349 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
L462348 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Well, now--
L462347 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What can you do when you have to be a man?
L462346 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
L462345 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We don't have time.
L462344 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
L462343 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
L462342 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
L462341 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Blood.
L462340 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
L462339 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What would you do, Dad?
L462338 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Is there some kind of trick answer?
L462337 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
L462336 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Shoot, Jimbo.
L462335 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hey--I want to ask you something.
L462334 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L462333 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
L462332 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes.
L462331 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You awake?
L462287 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I better clean this up before she sees it.
L462286 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's funny!
L462285 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Yeah!  Shh!
L462284 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And you dropped it?
L462283 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
L462282 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah!
L462281 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You thought I was Mom?

L462103 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
L462102 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
L462095 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
L462094 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You make any sandwiches?
L462093 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Mother--
L462016 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
L462015 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You buy me many things.  Thank you.
L462014 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
L462013 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You can't protect me.
L462012 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Hold it, Jim.
L462011 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tell him why we moved here.

L462078 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
L462028 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Sure.  Sure.
L462027 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Excuse us a minute?
L462005 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
L462004 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Sorry.

L461998 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Say, listen--
L461997 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
L461996 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
L461995 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You don't?
L461994 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
L462773 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Stay here.  That was my son!
L462772 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Frank!
L462592 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ No, honey.  No, he's not here.
L462591 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Is he there?
L462581 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Open it.
L462580 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Who's there?  Anyone there?
L462579 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I still think you should go down.
L462578 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ See?  It stopped.
L462577 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Look--just relax, will you?
L462576 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Are you going down there?
L462575 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ He's home.  I heard the car.
L462574 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
L462573 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ What's that pounding?
L462572 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Frank?  I'm frightened.
L462461 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That's right!
L462460 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
L462459 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
L462458 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
L462452 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
L462451 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No!
L462442 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Just relax, please relax!
L462441 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
L462019 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
L462018 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
L462010 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
L462009 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I was talking to Jim.
L462008 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ He's just loaded, honey.
L462007 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
L462002 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
L462001 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Really, Frank?  When was that?
L462000 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
L461993 +++$+++ u2584 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Well maybe she better start.
L461992 +++$+++ u2590 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ NEGRO WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!

L461990 +++$+++ u2584 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
L461983 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ In my mother's drawer.
L461982 +++$+++ u2584 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Where did you get the gun?

L462366 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
L462365 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ I hitched.
L462364 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How'd you get here?

L462196 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Plato.  It's a nickname.

L462479 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
L462476 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
L462475 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Do I have to spell it out?
L462474 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
L462473 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
L462470 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just tell a little white lie?
L462469 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
L462466 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
L462465 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
L462457 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Why should you be the only one.
L462456 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What's that got to do with it?
L462455 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
L462445 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I can't keep it to myself anymore--
L462444 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Good Lord!
L462443 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
L462438 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ And you wanted him to make a list!
L462437 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mom--I'm not--
L462436 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
L462435 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
L462434 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ How!
L462429 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
L462428 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
L462101 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Goodbye, dear.
L462100 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ 'Bye, Mom.
L462089 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
L462088 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
L462075 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ All right, darling.
L462074 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L462024 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That's a fine way to behave!
L462023 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
L462022 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What?
L462073 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You serious?
L462072 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
L462071 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay--
L462070 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
L462069 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
L462068 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
L462067 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How can anyone grow up in this circus?
L462066 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I bet you see right through me, don't you?
L462065 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Chicken?
L462064 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
L462063 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ "If he could" what?  You mean your father?
L462062 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ If he could--
L462061 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Pretty mixed up?
L462060 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
L462059 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L462058 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What a zoo!
L462057 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She eats him alive and he takes it.
L462056 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Things pretty tough for you at home?
L462055 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ But you don't think that's a solution.
L462054 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
L462053 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So then you moved?
L462052 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They never do.
L462051 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And your folks didn't understand?
L462050 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He called me chicken.
L462049 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mess that kid up?
L462048 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
L462047 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And they think they are protecting my by moving.
L462046 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
L462045 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Try the desk.
L462044 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
L462043 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
L462042 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
L462041 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
L462040 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't know why--!
L462039 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No.
L462038 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Leave me alone.
L462037 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
L462036 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No.
L462035 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
L462034 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
L462033 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Wash up and go home.
L462032 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
L462031 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Get lost.
L462030 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Grandma?
L462029 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
L462733 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
L462732 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Plato!
L462509 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Listen--
L462508 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Assault with a deadly weapon.
L461954 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L461953 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
L461952 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
L461951 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
L462752 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ They're killing him!
L462751 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
L462750 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
L462748 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
L462747 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
L462746 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ After he tried to shoot you?
L462745 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!  I got to find him.
L462744 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ We have to go back!
L462743 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!
L462706 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
L462705 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It is for me too.
L462704 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
L462703 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
L462702 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I never felt so clean before.
L462701 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So do you.
L462700 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You smell like baby powder.
L462699 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What?
L462698 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
L462697 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You disappointed?
L462696 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Is this what it's like to love somebody?
L462695 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What a relief!
L462694 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
L462693 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's something I should tell you, Judy.
L462692 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You don't need to do that.
L462691 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
L462690 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Are you?
L462689 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Maybe he's scared of the dark.
L462688 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
L462687 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why?
L462686 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
L462685 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What?
L462684 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi.
L462683 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Hi.
L462682 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
L462680 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Should we explore?
L462679 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't know.
L462678 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How many rooms do you think there are?
L462677 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
L462676 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Ever been in a place like this before?
L462654 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I bet you hear everything I say!
L462653 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You can't talk underwater!
L462633 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ See, we're very modern.
L462632 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
L462629 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ There's just one thing.  What about--
L462628 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well--we're newlyweds.
L462627 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
L462626 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why don't we just rent it for the season?
L462623 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
L462622 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
L462621 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, Jim!
L462571 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I feel as if I'm walking under water.
L462570 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You can trust me, Judy.
L462569 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
L462568 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm never going back.
L462567 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
L462566 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't know, but we can't stay here.
L462565 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where you going?
L462564 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Your lips are soft when you kiss.
L462563 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I felt like it.
L462562 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why did you do that?
L462561 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
L462560 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
L462559 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  Lots of times.
L462558 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Have you ever gone with anyone who--
L462557 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm getting that way, too.
L462556 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L462555 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
L462554 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
L462553 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
L462552 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
L462551 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
L462549 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
L462548 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No.
L462547 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
L462546 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Neither can I.
L462545 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
L462544 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
L462543 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You cold?
L462542 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm numb.
L462541 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You still pretty upset?
L462538 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
L462537 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No--I was just--maybe--
L462536 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You were looking for me, weren't you?
L462535 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ It doesn't matter to them.
L462534 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
L462533 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ They'll be looking for you.
L462134 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm not so bad.
L462133 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Goodbye!  See you!
L462132 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A what?
L462131 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
L462130 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh.
L462129 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ The kids take me.
L462127 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
L462126 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah.  So where's the high school?
L462125 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Dig the square wardrobe!
L462124 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah--why--
L462123 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You going there?
L462122 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where's Dawson High School?
L462121 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're really flipped--aren't you.
L462120 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Won't mother be proud.
L462119 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ See, I'm new.
L462118 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Who lives?
L462117 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
L462116 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Where what was.
L462115 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ "Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
L462114 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ "Life is crushing in on me."
L462113 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ See?
L462112 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Now that's true!
L462111 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You don't have to be unfriendly.
L462110 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Bully for you.
L462109 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi.  I saw you before.
L462815 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Hi.
L462814 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Hi, Plato!
L462672 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ It's all right.
L462671 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
L462670 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
L462669 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Plato, where's your father now?
L462635 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Talk to them!  Heavens!
L462634 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
L462631 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
L462630 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
L462625 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
L462624 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
L462391 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Okay.
L462390 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
L462389 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
L462388 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
L462387 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
L462386 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What's he like?
L462385 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Yes.  My best friend.
L462384 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Is he your friend?
L461964 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
L461963 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You said you'd call my father.
L461962 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She's being called for.
L461961 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ My mother?
L461960 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
L461959 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What?
L461958 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
L461945 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
L461944 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
L461943 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
L461942 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'll never get close to anybody.
L461941 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
L461940 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No.  I don't even know why I do it.
L461939 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
L461938 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No.
L461937 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You weren't looking for company, were you?
L461936 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
L461935 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
L461934 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
L461933 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That one?
L461932 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
L461931 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Do you think your father means that?
L461930 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
L461929 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
L461927 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
L461926 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
L461925 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ He hates me.
L461924 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L461923 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ He hates me.
L461922 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Judy--we're ready for you now.
L462321 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
L462320 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
L462319 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L462318 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
L462317 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I guess I just don't understand anything.
L462315 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
L462314 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I was talking to Dad.
L462311 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I didn't want to stop.
L462310 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
L462308 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ What?
L462307 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Didn't you forget something?
L462306 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ Hi.
L462305 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Good evening.
L462304 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Daddy--
L462303 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
L462302 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
L462301 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ No.  Why?
L462300 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Are you and Mom home tonight?
L462299 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ We were romantic then too--
L462298 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
L462297 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
L462296 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ How did you know that?
